# GitHub Actions compatibility

<!-- (internal) If this file is ever moved, please update the GitHub Actions template -->

This page is the production contract for the `hosted` profile used by `upload`
and the Buildkite plugin. If a feature is not listed, treat it as unsupported.

buildkite-gha requires Buildkite agent v3.129 or newer.

The plugin supports Linux x86-64 and native macOS arm64 importers and
jobs, with [experimental Windows jobs](#experimental-windows-jobs) available by
explicit opt-in. It sets the matching `runner.os` and `runner.arch` values. Runner labels
select a platform; they do not promise GitHub image, toolchain, or Xcode parity.
It sets `runner.environment` to `self-hosted` on every platform.

Generated Linux jobs use a dedicated `runner` user and need `buildkite-gha`
v0.13.7 or newer. Use `experimental-runner-user: false` temporarily if an image
cannot support the [privileged bootstrap](cli.md#run-linux-jobs-as-a-non-root-user).

GitHub's [workflow syntax reference](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax)
describes the original syntax. This page describes the subset that runs on
Buildkite.

## Support matrix

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ **Supported** | Available through the production plugin path. |
| 🟡 **Supported subset** | Available within the limits shown here. |
| ➖ **Accepted, no effect** | Validation accepts the syntax, but it does not change the build. |
| 🚧 **Not available in production** | The compiler or runtime supports it, but production upload blocks it. |
| ❌ **Unsupported** | Rejected or outside the compatibility contract. |

| Area | Status | Initial release boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Workflow and job names](#workflow-syntax) | 🟡 Supported subset | `name`, explicit `run-name`, and job names are retained. `run-name` supports expressions over `github` and `inputs`. |
| [Triggers and filters under `on`](#names-and-triggers) | 🟡 Supported subset | Buildkite creates builds; upload selects aggregate workflow groups for one effective event. `workflow_call` is supported for composition. |
| [Platforms](#job-configuration) | 🟡 Supported subset | The hosted importer provides Linux x86-64. The Agent API can map compatible selectors to hosted Linux, native macOS arm64, or explicitly enabled experimental Windows x86-64 targets. Labels do not provide GitHub image, toolchain, or Xcode parity. |
| [Jobs and dependencies](#job-configuration) | ✅ Supported | Static dependencies, matrix fan-out and fan-in, results, and bounded outputs. |
| [Matrix strategies](#matrix-strategies) | 🟡 Supported subset | Static matrices, `include`, `exclude`, and literal `max-parallel`. Needs-derived matrices can also read their producer's parallel limit. Maximum 256 instances per job. `fail-fast` has no effect. |
| [Shell steps](#commands-and-actions) | 🟡 Supported subset | Linux and macOS `bash`, `sh`, `pwsh`, `powershell`, `python`, and custom shell templates; PowerShell and MSYS2 on experimental Windows jobs. |
| [Conditions and expressions](#expressions-and-contexts) | 🟡 Supported subset | GitHub-compatible core operators and direct references to selected contexts. |
| [Reusable workflows](#reusable-workflows) | 🟡 Supported subset | Local, public, and approved private GitHub workflows with static or needs-derived typed inputs and direct job-output mappings. Local calls can inherit or explicitly map Buildkite secret authority. Private access requires a separate importer opt-in and existing Git access. |
| [Actions](#actions) | 🟡 Supported subset | Local and public JavaScript and composite actions on Linux, macOS, and experimental Windows jobs; verified Dockerfile and public prebuilt-image actions on Linux only. |
| [Checkout, artifacts, and cache](#actions) | 🟡 Supported subset | Only the audited versions and modes listed below. |
| [`GITHUB_TOKEN`](#github-token) | 🟡 Supported subset | One job-bound token for the event repository. Reusable-workflow jobs use the top-level workflow permissions. |
| [Other workflow secrets](#other-secrets-and-oidc) | 🟡 Supported subset | Static names in direct jobs and locally inherited or explicitly mapped reusable jobs resolve through the destination job's Buildkite secret authority. |
| [Job and service containers](#containers-and-services) | 🟡 Supported subset | Linux job containers and broadly compatible service definitions, including explicit registry credentials. |
| [Environments and snapshots](#deployment-environments) | 🟡 Supported subset | Literal environments on top-level jobs, with required-reviewer approval gates and environment-scoped secret names. Wait timers, branch policies, and custom rules are rejected. Snapshots are accepted with no effect. |
| [Variables](#repository-and-organization-variables) | 🟡 Supported subset | Repository, organization, and environment `vars` resolve inside a Buildkite job with GitHub's per-position scoping. `run-name` rejects `vars`. |
| [OIDC](#other-secrets-and-oidc) | 🟡 Supported subset | Host JavaScript and composite actions can request Buildkite OIDC tokens in jobs with `id-token: write`. |
| [Windows jobs](#experimental-windows-jobs) | 🟡 Experimental subset | Windows Server 2022 x86-64 requires explicit opt-in and a compatible Windows queue. No default Windows mapping. |
| [Other platforms](#job-configuration) and [providers](#repositories) | ❌ Unsupported | Windows arm64, Windows Server 2025, Linux arm64, macOS x86-64, GitHub Enterprise Server, and unlisted providers. |
| [Other GitHub services](#github-services) | ❌ Unsupported | No general emulation for Releases, Packages, Checks, deployments, or GitHub artifact APIs. |

## Experimental Windows jobs

Windows support is in development, not generally available. Import workflows
from Linux x86-64 or macOS arm64; Windows agents run generated jobs only.
`windows-latest` and `windows-2022` select Windows x86-64 when explicitly mapped
to a queue or enabled through Agent API resolution. They have no local preset
and are otherwise rejected, never silently redirected to Linux.

When Windows routing is enabled, the Agent API also maps `windows-2025` and
standard Depot `depot-windows-2025` labels (including `-4`, `-8`, `-16`, `-32`,
and `-64`) to the same `windows-medium` queue as `windows-latest`. It warns that
the queue may run Windows Server 2022 instead of 2025, and that Depot hardware,
caches, and networking are not preserved. This fallback requires an existing
eligible Hosted Windows queue; it does not provision Depot runners or promise
Server 2025 compatibility. These aliases have no local preset or explicit
Windows mapping; use Agent API resolution rather than a custom-label mapping.

Use a Windows Server 2022 queue with Buildkite agent v3.129 or newer, PowerShell
7 (`pwsh`), and Git on `PATH`. Runner labels do not install GitHub's runner image
or its tools. `runner.os` is `Windows` and `runner.arch` is `X64`. See
[explicit mappings and runtime distributions](cli.md#choose-runners-and-runtimes).

The default shell is `pwsh`. Explicit `pwsh` and Windows PowerShell
(`powershell`) steps, JavaScript actions, and composite actions are supported
within the same action restrictions documented below. Use UTF-8 for file
commands; Windows PowerShell needs `Out-File -Encoding utf8 -Append` rather
than its default UTF-16 redirection. [MSYS2 custom shells](#commands-and-actions)
are supported. `cmd` shells, containers,
services, Docker actions, custom images, and cache volumes
are not supported on Windows. Native Windows Server 2025 and arm64 execution
are not enabled by these mappings.

Windows environment overlays replace names case-insensitively but preserve the
winning spelling, so `env: {toolchain: nightly}` remains `$toolchain` in Bash.
`GITHUB_ENV` preserves the last assignment's spelling and value when names differ
only by case. Runtime context variables remain protected from step overrides.

## How workflows run on Buildkite

GitHub Actions combines run creation and workload definition in one file. Buildkite keeps them separate.

| GitHub Actions concept | Buildkite behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Workflow trigger | Buildkite integration, schedule, manual build, or API request |
| Workflow run | Existing Buildkite build |
| Job | Buildkite command job |
| Matrix entry | Buildkite command job |
| `needs` | `depends_on` with verified result transport |
| Step | Runs inside the job compatibility runtime |

No shadow GitHub Actions run is created. Buildkite owns scheduling, logs, retries, cancellation, and status.

Steps remain inside one job because they share a workspace, environment files, action state, and post-action cleanup.

### Repository fork events

`fork` runs when someone forks the source repository. Scalar, array, null, and
empty-map declarations and null/empty `types` are supported. `branches` is ignored;
nonempty activity types and other filters are rejected.
It does not enable pull requests from forks or `pull_request_target`.

Pipeline Triggers require a compatible backend, pinned workflow path/ref/SHA,
and the original linked payload. Discovery and checkout use the source
repository's server-resolved default-branch commit, never the forkee's branch or
commit or stale pipeline/webhook metadata. The complete payload, including
`github.event.forkee`, survives into `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`. Missing, malformed,
foreign-repository, or contradictory provenance fails closed, including rebuilds
without the original payload. Explicit snapshots must supply a full SHA and
the resolved source `repository.default_branch`; the runtime does not resolve it.

This adds no token authority or native GitHub Actions run. Release and select the
fork-capable runtime before deploying backend subscription defaults. Existing
dedicated hooks require a separately approved additive `fork` subscription;
deployment does not backfill them.

### Repository visibility events

`public` runs when a private repository becomes public. Scalar, array, null, and
empty-map declarations and null/empty `types` are supported. `branches` is ignored;
nonempty activity types and other filters are rejected.
Pipeline Triggers require pinned workflow path/ref/SHA and the original payload,
which must identify the source repository, mark it public, and omit `action`.
Discovery and checkout use the server-resolved default branch and immutable SHA,
not stale webhook or pipeline metadata. Explicit snapshots must provide that
resolved default branch. Missing or contradictory provenance fails closed,
including rebuilds without the original payload. No token authority is added.

Release and select the public-capable runtime before deploying backend
subscription defaults. Existing hooks need a separately approved additive update;
deployment does not backfill them.

### Wiki page events

`gollum` runs when wiki pages are created or edited. Scalar, array, null, and
empty-map declarations and null/empty `types` are supported. `branches` is ignored;
nonempty activity types and other filters are rejected.
Pipeline Triggers require pinned workflow path/ref/SHA and the original payload,
including a nonempty `pages` array with valid names, actions, and wiki commit SHAs.
Workflows and checkout use the source repository's server-resolved default branch
and pinned SHA, never a wiki commit. Explicit snapshots must supply the resolved
default branch. Page data remains in `github.event.pages` and `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`.
Missing, malformed, or contradictory provenance fails closed, including rebuilds
without the original payload. No wiki checkout or token authority is added.

Release and select the gollum-capable runtime before deploying backend subscription
defaults. Existing hooks require a separately approved additive update; deployment
does not backfill them.

### GitHub Pages build events

`page_build` accepts scalar, array, null, empty-map, and null/empty `types`
declarations. `branches` is ignored; nonempty activity types and other filters
are rejected. Pipeline Triggers require pinned workflow path/ref/SHA
and the original repository and Pages build payload, including build id, commit,
and status. Failed builds can trigger workflows. Execution uses the server-resolved
source default branch and pinned SHA, not the Pages build commit. Status and error
data remains in `github.event.build` and `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`. Missing or conflicting
provenance fails closed, including rebuilds without the original payload. Explicit
snapshots must supply the resolved default branch. This does not deploy Pages or
add token authority. Release and select the compatible runtime before backend
subscription defaults; existing hooks need a separately approved additive update.

### Repository star events

`watch` runs when someone stars the repository (`started`), not when they subscribe
to notifications or remove a star. Scalar, array, null, empty-map, null/empty `types`,
and `types: [started]` declarations are supported. `branches` is ignored; other
types and filters are rejected.
Pipeline Triggers require the original payload and pinned workflow path/ref/SHA.
Workflows and checkout use the source repository's server-resolved default branch,
not stale webhook branch metadata. The original payload remains in `github.event`
and `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`. Missing or conflicting provenance fails closed, including
rebuilds without the original payload. No token authority is added. Release and
select the compatible runtime before backend subscription defaults; existing hooks
need a separately approved additive update.

### Milestone lifecycle events

`milestone` supports `created`, `closed`, `opened`, `edited`, and `deleted`, all by
default. Scalar, array, null, empty-map, and null/empty `types` declarations select all
five; explicit `types` selects a subset. Issue/PR `milestoned` activities and
filters other than the ignored `branches` are rejected. Pipeline Triggers require pinned workflow
path/ref/SHA and the original payload, including milestone id, number, and title.
Workflows and checkout use the source repository's server-resolved default branch.
`github.event.milestone` and `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH` retain the original data. Missing
or conflicting provenance fails closed, including rebuilds without the original
payload. No token authority is added. Release and select a compatible runtime
before backend subscription defaults; existing hooks need a separately approved
additive update.

### Branch protection rule events

`branch_protection_rule` supports `created`, `edited`, and `deleted`, all by
default. Scalar, array, null, empty-map, and null/empty `types` select all three; explicit
`types` selects a subset. `branches` is ignored; other filters are rejected. Pipeline Triggers require
pinned workflow path/ref/SHA and the original rule id, name, and repository id
matching the source repository. Workflows and checkout use the server-resolved
default branch, not the rule's branch pattern. `github.event.rule` and
`GITHUB_EVENT_PATH` retain the original data. Missing or conflicting provenance
fails closed, including rebuilds without the original payload. No token authority
is added. Release and select a compatible runtime before backend subscription
defaults; existing hooks need a separately approved additive update.

### Discussion events

`discussion` supports `created`, `edited`, `deleted`, `transferred`, `pinned`,
`unpinned`, `labeled`, `unlabeled`, `locked`, `unlocked`, `category_changed`,
`answered`, `unanswered`, `closed`, and `reopened`, all by default. Scalar, array,
null, empty-map, and null/empty `types` select all; explicit `types` selects a
subset. `discussion_comment` supports `created`, `edited`, and `deleted` with
the same declaration forms.
Comments require a positive id and a `discussion_id` matching the discussion;
there is no command-word or trusted-commenter gating. `branches` is ignored;
other filters and unknown activities are rejected. Pipeline Triggers require
pinned workflow path/ref/SHA and the original payload, including discussion id,
number, and title. Each event uses its repository's server-resolved default
branch. A transfer emits `transferred` in the source repository and a separate
`created` event in the destination; each runs that repository's workflows.
`github.event.discussion`, `github.event.comment`, and `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH` retain the original data. Missing
or conflicting provenance fails closed, including rebuilds without the original
payload. No token authority or native Actions run is added. Release and select a
compatible runtime before backend subscription defaults; existing hooks need a
separately approved additive update. GitHub lists discussion webhooks as public
preview.

### Repository label lifecycle events

`label` supports `created`, `edited`, and `deleted` activities, all by default.
Scalar, array, null, empty-map, and `types: []` declarations select all three;
explicit `types` selects a subset. Issue/PR `labeled` actions and branch/tag/path
filters are not label lifecycle events and are rejected.

Pipeline Triggers require a compatible backend and the original linked payload.
Workflow discovery and checkout use the server-resolved default-branch commit,
not stale pipeline or webhook branch metadata. `github.event.label` and the
original event file retain the label data. Missing/malformed/foreign payloads
fail closed. Existing immutable workflow token policy and pipeline/repository/PR
restrictions remain unchanged. Release and select this runtime before deploying
the backend's label subscription defaults.

### Branch and tag lifecycle events

`create` and `delete` support scalar, array, null, and empty-map declarations.
They have no activity types or branch/tag/path filters. These events refer to
Git refs, not repository creation/deletion. GitHub does not deliver them when
more than three tags are created/deleted at once.

Pipeline Triggers require a compatible backend and the original linked webhook.
`create` uses the server-resolved created branch/tag commit (peeled for annotated
tags). `delete` uses the server-resolved default-branch commit, never the deleted
ref. Workflow selection and checkout share that immutable SHA. The deleted ref
remains available in `github.event.ref`; `github.ref` names the default branch.
Explicit snapshots must supply a full SHA, matching repository identity and,
for deletion, the resolved `repository.default_branch`. The runtime does not
resolve mutable refs or attest event-time SHAs from these SHA-less webhooks.

The original payload is digest-bound and hydrated into `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`.
Missing payloads fail rather than synthesizing provenance. Neither event adds
token authority: existing immutable workflow policy, pipeline opt-in, repository,
PR and merge-queue restrictions remain. Release and select this runtime before
deploying backend subscription defaults; this change performs no release,
deployment, or existing-hook migration.

### Aggregate workflow upload

The plugin accepts either one `workflow` path or a non-empty `workflows` array.
Private-preview GitHub Actions Pipeline Trigger builds can instead use an empty
plugin configuration and the single workflow selected by Buildkite.
`BUILDKITE_GITHUB_WORKFLOW_PATH` marks the selection. When present, the plugin
prefers the repository, path, and event ref from `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_REF`; the
workflow name or fallback path from `GITHUB_WORKFLOW`; the event from
`GITHUB_EVENT_NAME`; and the commit from `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SHA`. These values
must match the repository and checked-out workflow. The Buildkite-prefixed path
and event remain compatibility fallbacks, while `BUILDKITE_GITHUB_ACTION`
supplies the event activity. Explicit plugin selection takes precedence
over server workflow selection. Without either selection, the plugin fails.
The server-selected importer does not need a step key. The plugin uploads its
artifacts before the dynamic pipeline and scopes retrieval to the importer job
ID without using that UUID as a dependency key. Explicit-selector importers
still require a step key, and their generated groups depend on it.

Missing or untracked explicitly configured paths warn and are skipped, so
removing a workflow does not require a simultaneous pipeline configuration
change. If every configured path is missing or untracked, the importer succeeds
without uploading a pipeline. A missing or untracked Pipeline Trigger-selected
path fails because the server claimed that exact workflow selected the build.
Every present path must be a regular, tracked `.yml` or `.yaml` file inside the
repository. Directories, tracked files missing from the checkout, outside paths,
symlinks, and globs fail. A custom importer may upload one explicit regular
workflow from outside the repository, or an untracked one, unless it holds a
[matrix from a job output](#matrices-from-job-outputs).

Before assigning workflow identities and job keys, upload canonicalizes, sorts,
and deduplicates the paths.

All remaining runnable workflows use one artifact and pipeline transaction:

- Server-selected workflows emit jobs without a workflow group. Explicitly
  configured workflows retain groups, even when only one workflow is selected.
- Each group is labeled `:github: workflow · <workflow-name>`. An unnamed
  workflow uses its canonical path. A resolved, non-empty `run-name` appends
  ` — <run-name>`.
- Upload leaves the importer label unchanged.
- Each job publishes a provider check named
  `<workflow-name-or-path> / <job-id> (<effective-event>)`. Matrix jobs append
  their sorted values to the job ID.
- GitHub events publish GitHub checks. Origin events publish Origin checks.
- A workflow that does not declare the event becomes one top-level skipped step
  with no plan artifacts.
- An importer annotation links to each workflow skipped by event or filters. It
  shows configured events for event mismatches and the specific reason for
  filter mismatches. It also states when every workflow was skipped. If
  publication fails, upload warns but still succeeds.

Workflow names, group keys, and provider-check names stay the same across
events; only an appended run title can vary. Groups and replacement steps
depend on the importer; their child jobs do not repeat that dependency.
Without a group, each step carries the workflow condition and depends on the
importer if it has a step key. Deferred uploads retain the initial workflow's
grouping choice.

Reusable-only `workflow_call` files remain available to local callers but do not
create groups. Selecting only reusable workflows is an error.

A safe compilation or trigger-translation error replaces only that workflow
with a failing top-level step. The step:

- is labeled `:github: workflow · <workflow-name-or-path>`, with the resolved
  run title appended when present
- publishes redacted diagnostics as a job annotation
- publishes a `Workflow could not be run` provider check
- limits the check summary to 65,535 bytes
- exits with status 1

Other workflows continue compiling. An unsupported matrix derived from `needs`
outputs, including one inside a called reusable workflow, fails only its own
workflow after the event and repository variables resolve, so it never reports
`vars` values as unavailable or blocks other workflows. Missing or untracked
configured paths are omitted before the transaction. Invalid path states,
parse, event-input, admission, artifact, and upload failures still abort the
complete transaction.
Upload never publishes a partial pipeline.

If a workflow has both a compiler error and a skip reason, the compiler error
takes precedence.

### Compatibility diagnostics

Diagnostics keep guidance separate from implementation detail:

- `message` explains the visible cause and what to do.
- Optional `detail` records lower-level context such as resolved commits,
  adapter boundaries, or supported-version lists.

Text and JSON reports, Buildkite annotations, and generated failure artifacts
preserve both fields. GitHub check summaries show only the concise message.

## Workflow syntax

### Names and triggers

| Key | Status | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | ✅ Supported | Available as `github.workflow` and used to name generated work. |
| `run-name` | 🟡 Supported subset | An explicit non-empty value is appended to the workflow group label, when grouped. Compile-time `github` and `inputs` expressions are supported. The importer label, Buildkite build message, and provider-check names do not change. |
| `on` | 🟡 Supported subset | Does not create a Buildkite build. Selects and filters workflows for the effective event as described below. |

A workflow name is retained in generated work:

```yaml
name: CI
```

An explicit run name adds event-specific presentation without changing static
workflow or check identity:

```yaml
name: Deploy
run-name: Deploy ${{ inputs.target }} by @${{ github.actor }}
```

When grouped, this produces `:github: workflow · Deploy — Deploy production by @octocat`.
Omitted, blank, or blank-resolving values retain the static group label. On a
non-dispatch event, declared dispatch inputs use their typed zero values rather
than dispatch-only defaults. A skipped workflow does not synthesize dispatch
inputs.

Absent properties in a known input set are empty, so expressions such as
`${{ inputs.name || 'default' }}` work in run names, job names, concurrency
groups, and container images. Inputs waiting for job outputs remain unresolved
until those outputs are available.

GitHub also documents `vars` in its context-availability reference, but
`run-name` has no `vars` source here and a reference is rejected. See
[Repository and organization variables](#repository-and-organization-variables)
for every other position.

Buildkite controls when a build starts. The trigger declaration controls whether and under which condition the workflow group participates in that existing build:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
```

Upload selects one effective event, in this order:

1. The event in an explicit `--event-path` snapshot.
1. The GitHub event name accompanying Buildkite's reserved linked-webhook metadata.
1. A Buildkite environment fallback.

The fallback prefers `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME`, then preserves `push`, `pull_request`,
`workflow_dispatch`, and `schedule` from `BUILDKITE_GITHUB_EVENT` across
rebuilds. It preserves `issues` and `issue_comment` only with complete GitHub
Actions Pipeline Trigger workflow path, ref, and SHA identity. Otherwise:

| Buildkite source | Effective event |
| --- | --- |
| Pull request build | `pull_request` |
| `ui` or `api` | `push` |
| `schedule` | `schedule` |
| Any other source, including `trigger_job` | `push` |

An explicit snapshot does not consult contradictory live event fields. Linked
merge-group data must match the queue refs and commits. Linked release data must
match the Buildkite event, action, branch, and tag. Linked issue and comment data
must match the Buildkite action, default-branch ref, and repository. Comment
payloads may describe either issue or pull request conversations.
Review events require the original linked payload and matching immutable workflow
identity, PR number, head SHA, head/base branches, and repository identities.
They cannot fall back to a synthetic event on rebuilds without that payload.

Pipeline Trigger release events also require the original linked payload and
complete workflow ref/SHA identity. The repository, selected tag ref, Buildkite
branch/tag, and payload tag must agree; the workflow SHA must equal the build's
immutable peeled commit. Missing payloads on rebuilds fail explicitly.

Pipeline Trigger deployment events require the original linked payload and
complete workflow ref/SHA identity. The payload repository and deployment SHA
must match the build; the selected branch/tag ref must match `deployment.ref`.
For SHA-only deployments, the build branch is a commit-valued checkout label,
the Actions ref is empty, and workflow identity uses `<owner>/<repo>/<path>@<sha>`.
No default branch or current branch tip is substituted. Missing payloads on
rebuilds fail explicitly. These checks do not grant token or secret authority.

Pipeline Trigger merge groups require the original linked payload and complete
workflow ref/SHA identity too. Repository, action, speculative head ref/SHA,
and base branch/SHA must agree with the build. Rebuilds without the payload
fail explicitly. These builds support tokenless workflows; hosted merge-queue
workflow-token requests remain denied. Declared permissions alone do not cause
the compiler to request a token.

With the GitHub Code Access App, Buildkite resolves a release tag to its peeled
commit before creating the build. Without it, the plugin resolves Buildkite's
symbolic `HEAD` from the checkout as a compatibility fallback. The fallback
cannot infer a merge group, release, issues, or issue-comment event without
linked-webhook data.

The selected event then controls applicability, event-dependent compilation,
the group condition, and the provider-check suffix.

| Event | Supported trigger behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `push` | `branches`, `branches-ignore`, `tags`, and `tags-ignore`, including ordered negative patterns in an include list. Branch and tag filters select their corresponding ref kind. Matching `paths` and `paths-ignore` can be admitted for linked GitHub branch pushes when the bounded local-diff requirements below are met. |
| `pull_request` | `branches` and `branches-ignore` match the base branch. Omitted `types` defaults to `opened`, `synchronize`, and `reopened`; explicitly listed activity types must map exactly to a supported Buildkite source action. Matching `paths` and `paths-ignore` can be admitted when the bounded local-diff requirements below are met. |
| `merge_group` | Pipeline Triggers with a compatible server, and native Buildkite merge queue builds. Native builds require merge queue builds and Merge groups webhook delivery in the pipeline's GitHub settings. `branches` and `branches-ignore` match the base branch. Omitted `types` or `types: []` selects the only supported activity, `checks_requested`; other types and tag and workflow filters are rejected. `destroyed` is not a workflow event. `paths` and `paths-ignore` are ignored with a warning, matching GitHub, which does not evaluate path filters for `merge_group` events. The ref and SHA identify the speculative queue head, not the base commit. A push to a queue ref is still a push. |
| `release` | Pipeline Triggers accept all seven GitHub release activities. Native Buildkite release builds require **Additional Webhooks** > **Releases** and **Code** trigger mode and deliver only `published`, `created`, and `released`; workflows that select other activities emit `W_NATIVE_RELEASE_ACTIVITIES_UNDELIVERED`. Bare declarations and empty `types` lists select all activities. Other explicit `types` preserve exact selection, including a scalar selecting one activity. Malformed types, unknown activities, and branch, tag, path, and workflow filters are rejected. GitHub does not trigger `created`, `edited`, `deleted`, or `unpublished` for draft releases, and Buildkite rejects those deliveries. Pipeline Triggers require the GitHub Code Access App to select the workflow at the immutable peeled tag commit. The ref is `refs/tags/<tag_name>`. The SHA is the server-resolved peeled commit, or the checked-out commit for the native compatibility fallback. Existing hosted release `GITHUB_TOKEN` policy is unchanged. |
| `deployment`, `deployment_status` | Pipeline Triggers with a compatible server, or explicit event snapshots. Bare, array, null, and empty-map declarations are supported; activity types and event filters are not. Workflows and checkout use the deployment commit. The ref identifies its branch or tag and is empty for SHA-only deployments. Status states `error`, `failure`, `in_progress`, `queued`, `pending`, `success`, and `waiting` are supported ([GitHub status enum](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#deploymentstatusstate)); `inactive` cannot run a workflow. The genuine payload exposes `github.event.deployment` and `github.event.deployment_status`, including environment, state, `environment_url`, `log_url`, and `target_url` when present. Use job/step conditions on these values, not `types` or environment filters. No deployment creation or environment orchestration is added. |
| `create`, `delete` | [Branch and tag lifecycle](#branch-and-tag-lifecycle-events). No activity types or filters. Creation uses the exact ref's resolved commit; deletion uses the default branch. |
| `label` | [Repository label lifecycle](#repository-label-lifecycle-events). `created`, `edited`, and `deleted`, all by default. Workflows and checkout use the resolved default branch. |
| `fork` | [Repository forks](#repository-fork-events). Null/empty `types` accepted; `branches` ignored; other filters rejected. Workflows and checkout use the source repository's resolved default branch, not the forkee. |
| `public` | [Repository visibility](#repository-visibility-events). Null/empty `types` accepted; `branches` ignored; other filters rejected. Workflows and checkout use the resolved default branch. |
| `gollum` | [Wiki pages](#wiki-page-events). Null/empty `types` accepted; `branches` ignored; other filters rejected. Workflows and checkout use the source repository's resolved default branch, not a wiki commit. |
| `page_build` | [GitHub Pages builds](#github-pages-build-events). Null/empty `types` accepted; `branches` ignored; other filters rejected. Workflows and checkout use the resolved default branch, not the Pages build commit. |
| `watch` | [Repository stars](#repository-star-events). Only `started`, including with null/empty `types`; `branches` ignored; other filters rejected. Workflows and checkout use the resolved default branch. |
| `milestone` | [Milestone lifecycle](#milestone-lifecycle-events). `created`, `closed`, `opened`, `edited`, and `deleted`, all by default. Workflows and checkout use the resolved default branch. |
| `branch_protection_rule` | [Branch protection rules](#branch-protection-rule-events). `created`, `edited`, and `deleted`, all by default. Workflows and checkout use the resolved default branch, not the rule's pattern. |
| `discussion` | [Discussions](#discussion-events). The 15 supported activities, all by default, including null/empty `types`; `branches` ignored. Each event uses its repository's default branch, including separate source and destination events for transfers. |
| `discussion_comment` | [Discussion comments](#discussion-events). `created`, `edited`, and `deleted`, all by default, on the source default branch. |
| `issues` | Omitted `types` or `types: []` accepts every GitHub Actions issue activity. Nonempty `types` may contain `opened`, `edited`, `deleted`, `transferred`, `pinned`, `unpinned`, `closed`, `reopened`, `assigned`, `unassigned`, `labeled`, `unlabeled`, `locked`, `unlocked`, `milestoned`, `demilestoned`, `typed`, `untyped`, `field_added`, and `field_removed`. Unknown types and branch, tag, path, or workflow filters are rejected. In a GitHub Actions Pipeline Trigger build, Buildkite selects workflows and the checkout from the latest verified default-branch SHA; native issue-build settings, branch/path filters, and comment gating do not participate. Existing native Buildkite issue builds remain supported through linked webhook data and retain their own build-creation settings. |
| `issue_comment` | Omitted `types` or `types: []` accepts `created`, `edited`, and `deleted`; nonempty `types` may contain those activities. Both issue and pull request conversation comments are supported. Unknown types and branch, tag, path, or workflow filters are rejected. GitHub Actions Pipeline Trigger builds select workflows and the checkout from the latest verified default-branch SHA and do not inherit native command-word, trusted-commenter, PR-only, branch, or path gating. |
| `pull_request_review` | Pipeline Triggers support `submitted`, `edited`, and `dismissed`, all by default. Nonempty `types` selects activities, not review states. Use `if: github.event.review.state == 'approved'` on a job or step for approval-only execution. |
| `pull_request_review_comment` | Pipeline Triggers support inline diff-comment `created`, `edited`, and `deleted` activities, all by default. These are distinct from submitted reviews and `issue_comment` conversation comments. |
| `workflow_dispatch` | Selected only by an explicit snapshot or authoritative `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME` or `BUILDKITE_GITHUB_EVENT` value. Webhook-style branch, tag, type, and workflow filters are unsupported. |
| `schedule` | Selected for Buildkite scheduled builds. Buildkite owns cron configuration and does not expose which schedule started a build, so every `on.schedule` workflow is eligible for every Buildkite scheduled build. |
| `workflow_call` | Defines a reusable-workflow interface. A reusable-only local file is available to callers but does not become a top-level group. |
| `pull_request_target` | Intentionally unsupported for security reasons. Use `pull_request` with careful [checkout and ref handling](#checkout-action) instead; changing the event alone does not make untrusted code safe. |
| `repository_dispatch` | Not supported yet. GitHub repository dispatch requests do not start imported workflows through Pipeline Triggers. |
| `workflow_run` | Not supported yet. Running an imported workflow does not create a GitHub Actions run or emit its workflow-run events. Consider Buildkite trigger steps when migrating cross-pipeline orchestration. |
| `check_run`, `check_suite` | Not supported yet by GitHub Actions Pipeline Triggers. Native Buildkite builds on completed check runs are a separate integration. |
| Any other event | No Buildkite build source exists, so the trigger can never start a build. It is ignored with a `W_TRIGGER_EVENT_UNSUPPORTED` warning when the workflow also declares a supported event. A workflow declaring only unsupported events fails event-independent validation and is a skipped step in an uploaded pipeline. |

Supported `pull_request` activity types are `assigned`, `unassigned`, `labeled`, `unlabeled`, `opened`, `edited`, `closed`, `reopened`, `synchronize`, `converted_to_draft`, `locked`, `unlocked`, `enqueued`, `dequeued`, `milestoned`, `demilestoned`, `ready_for_review`, `review_requested`, `review_request_removed`, `auto_merge_enabled`, and `auto_merge_disabled`.

Both review events accept scalar, array, and map `on` declarations, including
empty maps and `types: []` for all activities. Unknown types and branch, tag,
path, and workflow filters are rejected. The workflow and checkout use the PR
head SHA, not the synthetic merge commit or an older reviewed commit; the event
ref remains `refs/pull/<number>/merge`. There is no default-branch-only workflow
requirement. Use `github.event.pull_request.head.ref` and `.base.ref` for branch
conditions. CI-skip commit directives do not suppress these events.

Review support requires the companion Buildkite backend and a runtime newer than
v0.59.0 containing this implementation. Existing dedicated repository hooks must
subscribe to both review events; deploying the backend does not backfill hooks.
Fork PRs are unsupported. Same-repository review builds retain the PR
`contents:read` token ceiling even for approving reviews; Buildkite secret and
queue policies still apply. The original linked webhook is required, so rebuilds
without retained payloads fail explicitly. See the
[server-selected event contract](cli.md#private-preview-pipeline-trigger-selection).

GitHub defines seven release activities: `published`, `unpublished`, `created`, `edited`, `deleted`, `prereleased`, and `released`. A bare `on: release` selects all seven. Pipeline Triggers accept all seven and apply GitHub's draft-release suppression before starting workflows. Native release builds deliver three and emit `W_NATIVE_RELEASE_ACTIVITIES_UNDELIVERED` when a workflow also selects `unpublished`, `edited`, `deleted`, or `prereleased`.

For push and pull-request path filters, once the workflow and checkout are
verified against the webhook commit, non-path exclusions retain their branch
or action conditions even if diff history is unavailable. Identity failures
remain errors regardless of those exclusions.

#### Push path filters

For a linked GitHub branch push, the importer binds the webhook repository,
ref, commit range, force state, and complete pushed-commit list to the Buildkite
build and local checkout. `HEAD`, the `origin` repository and branch, and the
workflow file must match the pushed commit.

Normal and force pushes use GitHub's two-dot `before..after` comparison. For a
new branch, the importer uses the parent of the oldest pushed commit only when
the complete commit set has one clear, single-parent boundary.

Added, modified, deleted, and type-changed paths can match. Patterns use the
same ordered matching as pull requests.

Admission fails when the evidence is unsafe or incomplete, including:

- a deleted ref or non-GitHub repository
- missing or shallow history
- stale or mismatched repository, ref, checkout, branch, workflow, commit set,
  or force state
- ambiguous new-branch history
- more than 1,000 pushed commits or 300 changed files
- renames, combined additions and deletions, malformed Git output, or invalid
  patterns

A verified local nonmatch produces an explicit skipped workflow step without
executing workflow jobs. The importer uses the local diff result; it does not
reproduce GitHub's 1,000-commit or diff-timeout fallback that can run a workflow
without matching changed paths.

Tag pushes do not evaluate path filters, matching GitHub. Explicit and generated event snapshots, and Buildkite environment fallbacks, cannot admit push path filters because they are not linked webhook evidence.

#### Pull request path filters

`paths` and `paths-ignore` support ordered GitHub patterns. For example, this runs for changes under `src`, except generated files:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - "src/**"
      - "!src/generated/**"
```

Before upload, the importer compares the pull request merge base with its head
in the local checkout (`base...head`). The linked webhook must provide full
base and head commit SHAs with one common merge base verified as an ancestor
of both commits. The checkout and filtered workflow must match the PR head.
The comparison uses those pinned commits, not the current base-branch tip.

Buildkite builds the PR head, not GitHub's synthetic merge. Path evaluation
does not depend on `merge_commit_sha` or `mergeable`, including for conflicting
and closed PRs. Workflows without path filters do not require diff history.

The check uses the checkout's existing Git access for public, private, and fork
pull requests. It does not call GitHub or use Buildkite `if_changed`.

| Admitted | Rejected |
| --- | --- |
| A matching added, modified, deleted, or type-changed path | Unavailable changed-path evidence |
| A copied destination that matches | A rename, or a diff containing both additions and deletions |
| At most 300 changed files from complete local history | Missing or shallow history, multiple merge bases, or more than 300 files |
| Matching webhook, PR head checkout, and workflow data | Unrelated history, mismatched identity or workflow, path or pattern containing a backslash, invalid pattern, or malformed Git output |

A verified local nonmatch, including an empty diff or changes all excluded by
`paths-ignore`, produces an explicit skipped workflow step without executing
workflow jobs. GitHub's unobservable diff-timeout fallback is not reproduced.

An unsupported or inexact filter replaces only the affected workflow with a
failing step. It never broadens when the workflow runs.

A top-level workflow that does not declare the effective event is excluded before event-dependent validation or compilation and represented by one top-level skipped command step. A workflow that declares that event remains represented by a group even when a same-event branch, tag, base-branch, or action condition evaluates false in Buildkite. If no directly runnable workflow declares the event, upload succeeds with a skipped-only pipeline.

### Reusable workflows

**🟡 Supported subset.** Calls may use a local path or a literal GitHub reference such as `owner/repository/.github/workflows/ci.yml@v1`. A remote reference resolves once per operation to an immutable commit and repository digest. Nested `./.github/workflows/...` calls resolve in that pinned repository.

Self-repository calls such as `$/.github/workflows/ci.yml` select the repository and exact commit containing the calling workflow. They use the same source verification described under [self-repository actions](#self-repository-actions), and retain the existing reusable-workflow access, secret-forwarding, cycle, and depth limits.

Verified self calls in the root workflow's repository support `secrets: inherit` and explicit secret mappings. Nested `$/` and `./` calls retain this forwarding scope. An explicit `owner/repository/...@ref` call leaves the scope, even if it names the same repository and commit; its nested self or local calls cannot restore it. Every forwarding edge still needs its own `secrets` declaration.

Private references work for the pipeline repository and cross-repository sources available to the importer's existing Git credentials. Enable them with the plugin's default-off `private-reusable-workflows` field or the matching `upload` flag. When the Buildkite Agent repository-provider credential helper supplies access, Buildkite approves each requested repository. Git access is also used when GitHub's anonymous API quota is exhausted, so a rate limit does not fail an otherwise authorized call. Missing and denied repositories, refs, and paths produce the same error.

**✅ Supported:**

- Local `./.github/workflows/...` paths.
- Literal public or approved private references to a `.yml` or `.yaml` file directly under `owner/repository/.github/workflows/`.
- `boolean`, `number`, and `string` inputs.
- Static input values. Caller values may use graph-time `github`, matrix, and parent reusable-workflow inputs with the supported operators and pure functions.
- String inputs that read `needs.<job>.outputs.<name>`, alone or inside a larger value such as `type=raw,value=${{ needs.meta.outputs.tag }}` or `${{ format('{0}-{1}', github.ref_name, needs.meta.outputs.tag) }}`. The call must list each job in `needs`. Every other part of the value must resolve before jobs run: literals, graph-time `github`, `vars`, matrix values, static parent inputs, and the supported operators and pure functions. Buildkite resolves the verified outputs and renders the value before each flattened callee job runs.
- Boolean and number inputs derived from needs outputs through a single expression, such as `deps: ${{ needs.detect.outputs.deps == 'true' }}` or `count: ${{ fromJSON(needs.detect.outputs.count) }}`. The same dependency and graph-time restrictions apply. Runtime evaluation preserves the declared type and rejects a mismatched result; a raw output string is not a boolean or number.
- Forwarding a needs-dependent parent input to a nested call as exactly `${{ inputs.<name> }}`, with the same declared type.
- Literal defaults and expression defaults over graph-time `github` values.
- Nested calls up to four levels.
- `secrets: inherit` for repository-local calls. Each nested edge must repeat it.
- Explicit repository-local mappings from a declared callee alias to one direct `${{ secrets.NAME }}` or `${{ secrets['NAME'] }}` caller reference.
- Required and optional `on.workflow_call.secrets` declarations.
- Caller-visible aggregate results.
- Outputs mapped directly from `jobs.<job>.outputs.<name>`.
- Call-level `if` over caller `github`, `inputs`, direct `needs`, and status functions.
- Workflow-level concurrency in local and public called workflows, including behind a call-level `if`. Groups may use the called workflow's static inputs. Each static call-matrix instance gets its own workflow gate. See [Concurrency](#concurrency).

**❌ Unsupported:**

- Dynamic workflow paths.
- Secret forwarding for public remote calls.
- Literal, compound, dynamic, or non-secret explicit mapping values.
- `needs.<job>.result`, whole `needs.<job>.outputs` objects, or needs values mixed with runtime-only values such as `github.run_id` in inputs.
- Combining a needs-dependent parent input with other text in a nested call.
- Dynamic matrices.
- Input defaults that reference `inputs`.
- Literal or compound output expressions.

Job-level `uses`, `with`, and `secrets` follow these boundaries.

If compilation fails after the complete job graph expands, upload preserves one
Buildkite item per expanded job. Jobs with compiler errors fail with their own
diagnostics, and their dependants are skipped. Independent jobs keep their
compiled plans and run normally. The items keep their normal labels, keys,
checks, and `needs` links. A runnable job is never emitted unless every job it
needs also has a plan. If compilation fails before the complete graph is known,
or the workflow takes a [matrix](#matrices-from-job-outputs) or
[runner selection](#runners-from-job-outputs) from a job output, upload uses one
workflow-level failing item instead.

For a local call with `secrets: inherit`, each flattened callee job requests only the static ordinary secret names referenced by that job or its workflow-authored action inputs. Inheritance is one hop: an omitted nested `secrets: inherit` removes ordinary secret authority from every job below that edge. It does not affect direct caller jobs or `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

Explicit mappings must target aliases declared by the called workflow. Every required alias must receive authority; an unmapped optional alias is empty. Nested mappings compose to the original Buildkite secret name and cannot recover an omitted same-named secret. Plans contain aliases and original names, never values. The runtime retrieves each original once, registers its value with both redactors, then projects it to the callee aliases.

`${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` may be forwarded to a declared alias. The alias remains part of the scoped workflow-token contract and never becomes an ordinary Buildkite secret.

Upload configures Git fallback before validating remote calls. After anonymous access fails, Git fetches a canonical credential-free HTTPS URL with the importer's existing credential configuration. Each Git invocation allows only the HTTPS transport, refuses redirects, verifies TLS, and checks received objects; these values are pinned for the exact repository URL and Git environment variables that would relax them are removed. The fetch stops if inherited `url.<base>.insteadOf` configuration rewrites the URL. Git pack input and extracted trees keep the anonymous source size and entry limits. Git output is suppressed, terminal prompts and askpass programs are disabled and inherited `http.extraHeader` and `http.cookieFile` values are reset so credentials come only from credential helpers, and credential material is never added to plans, generated pipeline YAML, workflow environments, or runtime jobs. Called repositories that may use Git fallback skip the one-hour mutable ref cache and resolve once per operation. Private actions remain unsupported.

A call condition runs in caller scope before static call-matrix expansion. It keeps the implicit `success()` guard. A false condition skips every flattened descendant, including jobs with `if: always()`, and exposes `skipped` with empty outputs to downstream `needs`. Nested calls evaluate ordered outer-to-inner guards. Callee job results do not change an outer guard. Call conditions cannot use `matrix`, `strategy`, callee inputs or needs, `steps`, `env`, `runner`, or `secrets`.

A call's `needs` governs its condition and scheduling, but does not appear in the called jobs' `needs` context. Each called job sees only dependencies it declares within its own workflow; a job without `needs` sees `{}` when serialized with `toJSON(needs)`.

A call without `if` checks only dependency results; conflicting matrix outputs do not affect that implicit success check.

The called workflow declares its inputs and outputs:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      target:
        type: string
        required: true
    outputs:
      image:
        value: ${{ jobs.build.outputs.image }}

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      image: ${{ steps.image.outputs.value }}
    steps:
      - id: image
        run: echo "value=app-${{ inputs.target }}" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
```

The caller can pass a static input:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/build.yml
    with:
      target: production
```

Or defer a string input until a prerequisite publishes its output:

```yaml
jobs:
  call:
    needs: prepare
    uses: ./.github/workflows/build.yml
    with:
      target: ${{ needs.prepare.outputs.target }}
```

### Permissions

**🟡 Supported subset.** Permissions matter only when a job statically references `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` or `github.token`, or an effective action input default can reach `github.token` for the event provider.

A workflow-level permissions map can request repository access:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

Supported values are `read`, `write`, and `none`. Supported repository permission names are `actions`, `artifact-metadata`, `attestations`, `checks`, `contents`, `deployments`, `discussions`, `issues`, `packages`, `pages`, `pull-requests`, `security-events`, and `statuses`. The separate `id-token` permission is also supported.

An omitted map defaults to exactly `contents: read` when a token is needed. This deterministic default does not inherit GitHub repository or organization settings. Hosted token issuance uses only the top-level map. Job-level repository permission maps do not narrow or expand `GITHUB_TOKEN`; the separate `id-token` permission retains job-level behavior. Write access therefore requires an explicit top-level map.

Put `permissions: read-all` or `permissions: write-all` at the top level to apply the same access to all 13 supported repository permissions listed above. These shorthands exclude `id-token`, `models`, `repository-projects`, `code-quality`, `metadata`, and `vulnerability-alerts`.

Jobs expanded from reusable workflows use the top-level requesting workflow's repository permissions for `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Only this immutable top-level map is enforced server-side; permission maps in called workflows do not narrow `GITHUB_TOKEN`. The separate `id-token` permission retains called-workflow narrowing. Warnings identify job-level repository maps that differ from the applied top-level permissions and called-workflow maps that would have narrowed the token scope.

To grant repository access, list each required permission at the top level, such as `contents: write`. Every job that receives `GITHUB_TOKEN` gets that access. You cannot give different repository permissions to individual jobs. Use top-level `read-all` or `write-all` only when every job should get read or write access for every supported repository permission. An empty top-level permissions map, or one that contains only `none`, creates no token. Use GitHub's exact permission names.

### Environment and defaults

| Key | Status | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `env` | 🟡 Supported subset | Workflow, job, and step maps use normal precedence; the most specific value wins. Individual values may use supported interpolation. An entire map cannot be expression-valued. |
| `defaults.run.shell` | 🟡 Supported subset | Supported at workflow and job level, subject to [shell and platform limits](#commands-and-actions). Windows defaults to `pwsh`, other host jobs to `bash`, and job containers to `sh`. |
| `defaults.run.working-directory` | 🟡 Supported subset | Supported at workflow and job level for workspace-relative paths. |

A job-level value overrides the same workflow-level environment variable:

```yaml
env:
  GOFLAGS: -mod=readonly

jobs:
  test:
    env:
      GOFLAGS: -race
```

Workflow-level run defaults set the shell and working directory:

```yaml
defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash
    working-directory: ./src
```

### Concurrency

**🟡 Supported subset with different queue behavior.** A static group becomes a repository-scoped, case-insensitive Buildkite concurrency group. Groups may use supported `github` fields, static reusable-workflow inputs, and concrete `matrix` and `strategy` values at job level. Core operators, `fromJSON`, and the case-insensitive string functions `startsWith`, `contains`, and `endsWith` are supported when the whole expression resolves during compilation. A needs-derived matrix consumer can also read its producer's outputs for its job group; see [Scheduling from matrix-producer outputs](#scheduling-from-matrix-producer-outputs). Other runtime `needs` values remain unsupported.

A workflow can set a group and cancellation expression while a job uses a matrix-derived group:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/pull/') }}

jobs:
  deploy:
    concurrency: deploy-${{ matrix.target }}
```

Called workflows keep workflow-level concurrency around all flattened jobs. Inputs can derive the group from a caller matrix:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      target:
        type: string
        required: true

concurrency: deploy-${{ inputs.target }}

jobs:
  plan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [{run: ./plan}]
  apply:
    needs: plan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [{run: ./apply}]
```

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        target: [staging, production]
    uses: ./.github/workflows/deploy.yml
    with:
      target: ${{ matrix.target }}
```

Nested called workflows keep nested gates. Jobs within one called workflow remain parallel except for their declared `needs` and job-level concurrency. Jobs or nested called workflows that reuse an enclosing workflow group remain unsupported.

Calls with `needs` are supported when their prerequisites have no concurrency or statically disjoint groups. The compiler checks transitive prerequisites, matrix instances, and nested reusable-workflow groups. A prerequisite sharing the called workflow's group, an unresolved group, or a cycle involving gate dependencies and Buildkite's ordered concurrency queues is rejected. For example, `needs: prepare` is supported for a called workflow in group `deploy` when `prepare` has no concurrency or uses a separate group such as `build`.

The opening gate waits for every external prerequisite, including failed or skipped jobs, so runtime conditions still decide whether the call runs. Buildkite reserves the gate's queue position at pipeline upload, before those prerequisites finish; GitHub admits the called workflow afterward. A later call or build using the group can therefore wait behind an earlier call whose prerequisites are unfinished. `W_REUSABLE_WORKFLOW_CONCURRENCY_QUEUED_BEFORE_PREREQUISITES` reports this difference once per root call. Mutual exclusion is preserved. This analysis covers the generated pipeline, not dependencies introduced by other pipelines or later manual uploads.

A call with `if` keeps the called workflow's gate unless its condition is already false. Buildkite reserves the group at pipeline upload, before the runtime evaluates the condition:

| Call condition at compile time | Gate | Condition diagnostic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| True, such as `github.event_name == 'pull_request'` on a pull request | Emitted | None |
| False, such as the same condition on a push | Omitted; the jobs skip without entering the group, as on GitHub | None |
| Runtime-dependent, such as `vars.DEPLOY == 'true'` | Emitted; a skipped call still waits for the group and holds it until its jobs finish | `W_REUSABLE_WORKFLOW_CONCURRENCY_ENTERED_BEFORE_CALL_CONDITION` |

Buildkite queues every waiting entry. It does not replace GitHub's existing pending entry. The `queue` key is unsupported.

A workflow with workflow-level `concurrency` cannot hold a matrix from `fromJSON(needs.<job>.outputs.<name>)`; see [Matrices from job outputs](#matrices-from-job-outputs).

When workflow-level `cancel-in-progress` is `true`, Buildkite warns and leaves superseded builds running. The same behavior applies when an expression resolves to `true` and when a called workflow sets it. Job-level `cancel-in-progress` is unsupported.

To cancel earlier running builds on the same branch, turn on [Cancel Intermediate Builds](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/configure/canceling-builds#cancel-running-intermediate-builds) under pipeline **Settings > Builds**. This setting works by branch, not by concurrency group.

Cancel the whole Buildkite build rather than one job when a workflow-level concurrency gate is active.

## Job syntax

### Job configuration

| Key | Status | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | ✅ Supported | Labels may use static `github`, reusable-workflow `inputs`, and concrete `matrix` and `strategy` values. |
| `needs` | ✅ Supported | Accepts a string or list of static job IDs. Matrix fan-out and fan-in are automatic. |
| `runs-on` | 🟡 Supported subset | Explicit mappings are authoritative. The Agent API returns a complete target for every other selector and can return a fallback warning annotation. The local preset accepts `ubuntu-latest`, `ubuntu-24.04`, `ubuntu-22.04`, and `macos-latest`. Labels are case-insensitive. Expressions may use concrete `matrix` and `strategy` values or [values from a job output](#runners-from-job-outputs) to resolve to an accepted label or label list. |
| `if` | 🟡 Supported subset | Runs before the job starts. See [Conditions](#conditions). |
| `outputs` | 🟡 Supported subset | Maps step outputs for consumption through `needs`. A job may publish 64 outputs of up to 1 KiB each. Ambiguous matrix output values stop the job with an error. |
| `env`, `defaults.run` | 🟡 Supported subset | Uses the [workflow-level behavior](#environment-and-defaults). |
| `timeout-minutes` | 🟡 Supported subset | Accepts literal timeouts up to 360 minutes. Expressions are rejected. |
| `continue-on-error` | ✅ Supported | Accepts literal booleans or expressions that produce a Boolean. A tolerated failure remains visible as a Buildkite soft failure and reports `success` through downstream `needs`. |
| `environment` | 🟡 Supported subset | Requires GitHub environment access at compile time. See [Deployment environments](#deployment-environments). |
| `snapshot` | ➖ Accepted, no effect | Custom image creation is not implemented. |

Job names can interpolate matrix values:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    name: Test Go ${{ matrix.go }}
```

A job can depend on another job by ID:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    # ...
  test:
    needs: build
```

Runner labels can resolve from a matrix value:

```yaml
runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
```

A job-level condition can combine a branch check with status:

```yaml
if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && success()
```

Job outputs can pass a step output to a dependent job:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      image: ${{ steps.image.outputs.value }}
    steps:
      - id: image
        run: echo "value=app:latest" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "${{ needs.build.outputs.image }}"
```

Results and outputs come from verified producer manifests. Retrying one producer can make selection ambiguous; retry the whole build.

A job with `continue-on-error: true`, or an expression that resolves to `true`, stops ordinary steps after a failure, runs eligible failure and always steps plus post-actions, publishes its outputs, and reports `success` through `needs.<job>.result`. The generated Buildkite job returns reserved status `78` for the tolerated workflow failure and soft-fails only that status, so the failure remains visible without blocking dependent jobs. Job timeout expiry remains `cancelled` and is never tolerated.

Runner labels are case-insensitive. Runner aliases such as `macOS-latest` use
the same target as `macos-latest`. Local Linux presets use the corresponding
Noble or Jammy hosted-toolchains image with default Buildkite agent targeting.
An explicit immutable image overrides the preset for a configured profile.

An explicit mapping is authoritative and bypasses Agent API resolution. It
declares that the selector runs on Linux x86-64, except for the known macOS
labels, which select Darwin arm64, and the experimental Windows labels, which
select Windows x86-64. Both reject images. For every other selector,
the job-scoped Agent API owns compatibility and returns the complete queue,
platform, and host environment. The importer applies that target verbatim
and publishes returned fallback warnings as annotations.

For eligible Namespace-backed Linux queues, the backend selects native GHA
images through opaque Buildkite agent tags, such as
`agents: {queue: linux-medium, nsc-gha-image: ubuntu-24.04}`, instead of a
step-level `image`. The backend owns eligibility and label mapping; the CLI
does not interpret provider tag names. macOS and Windows do not use this path.
Immutable `image` targets remain supported for other agents, explicit mappings,
heuristic fallbacks, and older backends. A workflow's `jobs.<job>.container.image`
remains a separate job container executed inside the selected host environment.

When the Agent API rejects a selector, the importer reports the server's
reason at the job's `runs-on` in the workflow diagnostics annotation instead
of falling back to a built-in preset, so a cluster without the expected hosted
queue fails before pipeline upload with the cluster and queue named:

| Rejection | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_queue` | The labels are compatible, but the job's cluster has none of the hosted queues they need. Create the named queue or configure an explicit runner mapping. |
| `incompatible_labels` | The labels require an operating system or architecture hosted agents do not provide. |
| `no_cluster` | The job is not in a cluster, so no hosted queue can be selected. |

Windows labels keep the local Windows guidance. Unknown rejection codes render
the server message with generic mapping guidance. Explicit mappings are not
checked against the cluster yet.

If the Agent API cannot be reached, the importer warns on stderr, adds a
warning annotation, and falls back to the built-in presets.

Explicit mappings can also attach one [Buildkite Hosted cache
volume](cli.md#configure-generated-job-cache-volumes) to generated jobs. This
configuration is outside the GitHub workflow and does not change workflow
syntax or action inputs.

`validate --profile hosted` has no job-scoped API and admits only the local
`macos-latest` preset.

#### Runners from job outputs

**🟡 Supported subset.** A job without a matrix can select its runner from one
declared output of a prerequisite with exactly one static instance:

```yaml
plan:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  outputs:
    runner: ${{ steps.select.outputs.runner }}
  steps:
    - id: select
      run: echo 'runner=["ubuntu-22.04"]' >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
build:
  needs: plan
  runs-on: ${{ fromJSON(needs.plan.outputs.runner) }}
  steps:
    - run: echo ready
```

A plain output can supply a single label with
`runs-on: ${{ needs.plan.outputs.runner }}`. Label templates, label lists, and
expressions using the existing pure functions are also supported. Every
output reference, including in an unselected branch, must name the same
producer output through `needs.<job>.outputs.<name>`. A reusable workflow may
receive that value through a string input and forward the input unchanged to
another workflow. Its caller's output retains its original producer binding;
it does not become part of the callee's `needs` context.

The initial upload creates `:github: runs-on · build`, with check
`build (runs-on)`, and reports `W_RUNS_ON_DEFERRED`. This step reads the verified
output, recompiles the workflow, and uploads `build` and every job that
transitively depends on it. Runner mappings, live Agent API resolution,
platform availability, admission, and token authority apply as for static
jobs. Runner fallback warnings appear as annotations on the deferred step.
The output supplies scheduling data only, never workflow source or
credential authority.

Runner selection uses the same [deferred upload rules](#matrices-from-job-outputs)
for snapshots, action locks, graph budgets, downstream ownership, skipped
producers, and retries. The producer output is limited to 1 KiB. Independent
runner and matrix continuations may coexist, but a component containing runner
selection cannot join or start another deferred stage. Matrix-only components
retain their supported joins and chained stages. A dynamic-runner consumer cannot also
declare a matrix. Workflow-level concurrency is unsupported on the root or
on a reusable workflow containing or depending on a deferred job. This does
not add dynamic environments or concurrency values. Missing outputs, invalid
label types, and rejected runner targets fail the deferred step without
uploading its jobs.

Use `validate` or `compile --format ir-json` to inspect the deferred graph;
`compile --format pipeline` cannot emit it. See
[Deferred uploads inside the build](cli.md#expand-a-matrix-inside-the-build).

### Deployment environments

A job-level `environment` needs GitHub environment configuration at compile
time. Inside a Buildkite job, `upload` and `compile` resolve each declared
environment automatically through the job-scoped Agent API
(`github-actions/environments`; rollout status in
[docs/plans/environment-resolution-backend.md](plans/environment-resolution-backend.md)).
The Buildkite backend reads the environment's protection rules, secret
names, and variables from GitHub with its own credentials, restricted to the
pipeline's configured repository, and returns only that snapshot: no GitHub
token and no secret value ever reaches the importer. This is the only environment access
path; there is no GitHub token option. Resolution is GitHub.com-only, so
GitHub Enterprise Server repositories cannot declare environments. Any
resolution failure fails the compile instead of degrading to an unprotected
default, and environments are only resolved when a workflow declares them.
One upload resolves all of its distinct environments in one batched request.
The backend owns the resolution limits — at most 20 environments per request
plus per-job and per-App-installation hourly budgets — and its rejection
fails the compile with the backend's error.

Outside a Buildkite job, `compile` has no environment access, so workflows
that declare environments fail to compile with an error naming the job.
`validate --profile hosted` reports the same failure as a diagnostic.

| Environment feature | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Literal `environment` name, with or without `url` | ✅ Supported on top-level workflow jobs. Expression names and reusable-workflow jobs are rejected. |
| Required reviewers | 🟡 One Buildkite block step per workflow and environment gates the affected jobs. Any user who can unblock the pipeline can approve; GitHub reviewer lists, `prevent_self_review`, and administrator bypass are not enforced. |
| Environment secrets | 🟡 Referenced secret names defined in the environment resolve to the Buildkite secret `<ENVIRONMENT>_<NAME>`. Other names resolve unchanged. Values stay in Buildkite Secrets; only names are read from GitHub. |
| Environment variables | 🟡 `${{ vars.NAME }}` resolves in runner-evaluated fields of jobs that declare the environment, over repository and organization variables. Job `if` and compile-time fields never see environment variables. See [Repository and organization variables](#repository-and-organization-variables). |
| Wait timers | ❌ Rejected at compile time. |
| Deployment branch policies | ❌ Rejected at compile time. |
| Custom deployment protection rules | ❌ Rejected at compile time. |
| `environment.url`, deployment records | ➖ Accepted, no effect. Builds do not create GitHub deployments or deployment statuses. |

Secret `DEPLOY_KEY` in environment `production` resolves to Buildkite secret
`PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_KEY`: the prefix is the upper-cased environment name with
every character outside `A-Z`, `0-9`, and `_` replaced by `_`, and a leading
`_` added when the name starts with a digit (environment `1st` gives
`_1ST_DEPLOY_KEY`). Distinct environments keep distinct values under Buildkite
Secret access policies.
Generated keys must be storable in Buildkite Secrets: compilation fails when a
key would exceed 255 characters or begin with `BK` or `BUILDKITE`, so rename
such environments or secrets.

The approval gate is a block step with `blocked_state: running`, so ungated
jobs keep running while approval is pending. The gate appears whenever the
workflow compiles, even if the gated job's own condition would skip it. Matrix
instances of one job share one gate. Gated jobs cannot be retried manually; run
a new build for a fresh approval.

Environment configuration is read once per compile, so changes on GitHub apply
to the next build. Buildkite OIDC tokens do not carry a GitHub `environment`
claim.

### Repository and organization variables

`${{ vars.NAME }}` follows GitHub's scoping. Inside a Buildkite job, `upload`
and `compile` read the event repository's repository and organization
variables through the job-scoped Agent API (`github-actions/variables`) when
any applicable workflow, a reusable workflow it calls, or an input default of
an action it uses references `vars`; workflows without a `vars` reference
make no request, and neither do events from providers other than GitHub.com.
One upload makes at most one request, whether or not a workflow declares an
environment. The
Buildkite backend reads the variables from GitHub with its own credentials,
restricted to the pipeline's configured repository, and bounds the response
(500 repository and 1000 organization names, 48 KiB per value, 256 KiB
combined). Its rejection, rate limit (10 requests per job per hour), or
GitHub outage fails the compile of every workflow that references `vars` with
the backend's error and any `Retry-After` delay; other workflows still upload.
A backend without the endpoint, or an organization that has opted out,
returns 404, which resolves both scopes as empty rather than failing the
compile. A repository and organization that define no variables resolve the
same way. Either way every `vars` name evaluates to an empty string, in
compile-time fields too, so `runs-on: ${{ vars.FAILOVER_RUNNER ||
'ubuntu-latest' }}` selects `ubuntu-latest`. Outside a Buildkite job,
`compile` has no variable source: runtime references evaluate to empty
strings, and compile-time fields that reference `vars` fail to compile.

Each job's plan carries the scopes as `organization_vars`, `repository_vars`,
and, for jobs that declare an environment, `environment_vars`. The compiler
and runtime build the `vars` context per position the way GitHub does:

| Position | `vars` context |
| --- | --- |
| `jobs.<id>.if` and reusable-workflow call `if` | Repository over organization variables. GitHub evaluates these before the job's environment applies, so environment variables are never visible here. Check environment variables in a step `if`. |
| Job `env`, `defaults.run`, `outputs`, service credentials, every step field, and action input defaults | Environment over repository over organization variables. |
| Compile-time fields (`runs-on`, `strategy`, `concurrency`, job names, container images, reusable-workflow inputs) | Repository over organization variables. Without a source, such as `compile` outside a Buildkite job, a reference fails to compile. `environment` names must stay literal. See [Compile-time expressions](#compile-time-expressions). |

Names match case-insensitively, and a higher scope replaces a lower scope's
name spelled differently. A name no scope defines evaluates to an empty
string, as on GitHub; it is not a compile error. Dynamic access such as
`vars[matrix.name]`, `vars.*`, and `toJSON(vars)` reads the same per-position
context. Matrix instances share their job's environment variables; jobs
without an environment, including every reusable-workflow job, see repository
and organization variables only. `GITHUB_TOKEN` and secret authority planning
never resolves `vars`: a job or step gated by `if: vars.PUBLISH == 'true'`
keeps its token and secret requests whatever the variable's value, because
every condition keeps `vars` for the runtime to evaluate, and a step input
such as `${{ vars.ENABLED == 'yes' && github.token || '' }}` requests the
token and fails under `permissions: {}` as it does without variables.

```yaml
deploy:
  runs-on: ${{ vars.RUNNER }}
  if: vars.DEPLOY_ENABLED == 'true'
  environment: production
  env:
    AWS_REGION: ${{ vars.AWS_REGION }}
  steps:
    - if: vars.TIER == 'gold'
      run: echo "$AWS_REGION"
```

Values are plain configuration, not secrets: they are stored in the build's
job plan artifacts and are visible to anyone who can read build artifacts, and
`compile --format ir-json` prints both scopes in the IR whenever the workflow
references `vars`. A value a compile-time field uses also appears wherever
that field does: a job name or matrix value becomes a step label in the
pipeline YAML, and a runner label that cannot be mapped is quoted in the
compile diagnostic. Runtime references, processing reports, and resolution
errors never carry values. See
[Variables](security.md#variables) in the security guide.

### Matrix strategies

| Key | Status | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `matrix` | 🟡 Supported subset | Literal rows. Authored values and expression-valued definitions can use compile-time `github`, `event`, reusable-workflow `inputs`, and `fromJSON` values. A whole matrix can be `fromJSON(needs.<job>.outputs.<name>)`; see [Matrices from job outputs](#matrices-from-job-outputs). |
| `include`, `exclude` | 🟡 Supported subset | Literal combinations or expressions that resolve to arrays of objects during compilation. A whole `include` list can be `fromJSON(needs.<job>.outputs.<name>)`. |
| `max-parallel` | 🟡 Supported subset | Literal value on ordinary job matrices, or [a limit from the matrix producer's output](#scheduling-from-matrix-producer-outputs). Reusable-workflow call matrices with more than one instance are rejected because flattening cannot preserve invocation-level parallelism. |
| `fail-fast` | ➖ Accepted, no effect | A failed matrix entry does not cancel its siblings. |

A strategy can combine parallelism, static matrix values, and exclusions:

```yaml
strategy:
  max-parallel: 2
  matrix:
    go: ["1.25", "1.26"]
    os: [ubuntu-22.04, ubuntu-24.04]
    exclude:
      - go: "1.25"
        os: ubuntu-24.04
```

Whole matrices, dimensions, and `include` or `exclude` lists can use static JSON:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: ${{ fromJSON(inputs.OPERATING_SYSTEMS) }}
    include: ${{ fromJSON(github.event.inputs.extra_jobs) }}
    exclude: ${{ fromJSON(github.event.matrix_exclusions) }}
```

Static matrices on reusable-workflow calls compose with static matrices in
called workflows, including nested calls. Each call instance receives its
concrete `matrix` values and each called workflow receives its declared
`inputs` before its matrix expands.

A job may expand to at most 256 instances.

#### Matrices from job outputs

**🟡 Supported subset.** A matrix whose whole `matrix` or whole `include` list
is exactly `fromJSON(needs.<job>.outputs.<name>)` expands after the producing
job runs:

```yaml
plan:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  outputs:
    matrix: ${{ steps.plan.outputs.matrix }}
  steps:
    - id: plan
      run: echo 'matrix=[{"target":"amd64","runner":"ubuntu-latest"}]' >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
build:
  needs: plan
  runs-on: ${{ matrix.runner }}
  strategy:
    matrix:
      include: ${{ fromJSON(needs.plan.outputs.matrix) }}
publish:
  needs: build
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

The initial upload creates `plan` and one deferred step,
`:github: matrix · build`, with check `build (matrix)`. That step waits for
`plan`, reads the verified `matrix` output, expands it with the static-matrix
rules, recompiles only `build` and the jobs that transitively need it, such as
`publish`, and uploads them with the initial workflow's grouping. Every other
job is uploaded once, up front. The deferred step reports `W_MATRIX_DEFERRED` at
compile time and leaves the deferred jobs `not-evaluated` in processing
reports, so `validate` and `compile --format ir-json` show the graph shape
while `compile` cannot render the pipeline YAML for the workflow. See
[Expand a matrix inside the build](cli.md#expand-a-matrix-inside-the-build).

Deferred matrices can join. Each matrix owns every downstream job, including
dependencies introduced by reusable-workflow inputs and call conditions. When
two downstream sets intersect, they merge under one deferred step; merging
continues through indirect intersections. A job with `needs: [build, test]`
gives the deferred `build` and `test` matrices one owner, which uploads both
branches and their join once. Sharing only a producer does not merge
otherwise independent matrices. Prerequisites outside the downstream sets stay
in the initial upload. The owner waits for all its matrix producers before
expanding any branch.

Deferred matrices can chain. When a matrix reads its rows from a job that is
itself deferred, the component expands in stages:

```yaml
package:
  needs: build            # build is the deferred matrix above
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  outputs:
    targets: ${{ steps.targets.outputs.targets }}
deploy:
  needs: package
  runs-on: ${{ matrix.runner }}
  strategy:
    matrix:
      include: ${{ fromJSON(needs.package.outputs.targets) }}
release:
  needs: [publish, deploy]
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

The initial upload still creates one deferred step for the component,
`:github: matrix · build`, which owns `build`, `package`, `publish`, `deploy`,
and `release`. After `plan` runs, that step expands `build`, uploads `package`
and `publish`, and adds the next stage's step, `:github: matrix · deploy`,
which waits for `package` and uploads `deploy` and `release`. Each stage
recompiles the workflow with the rows the stages before it resolved and
uploads only the jobs whose rows now exist, to any depth. `W_MATRIX_DEFERRED`
names the matrices that later stages expand.

The expanded jobs are identical to the jobs a literal matrix with the same rows
produces: same step keys, labels, checks, `needs`, and outputs. Row values
reach `runs-on`, `name`, `if`, `env`, and steps exactly as static matrix values
do, and nothing else. `runs-on: ${{ matrix.runner }}` resolves through the
importer's explicit runner mappings or the same Agent API resolution as static
jobs, with the same admission, capability, and token rules, so a producer
cannot select an unmapped queue or widen permissions. Separate declared outputs
can supply the consumer's [scheduling values](#scheduling-from-matrix-producer-outputs)
within that subset's limits. The deferred step also reads remote reusable workflows and
actions the way the importer did, including through Git when
`private-reusable-workflows` is enabled.

Limits and rejected shapes:

- The matrix producer must run on Linux or macOS: its queue also runs the
  deferred upload, and Windows importers are unsupported. Expanded jobs may
  target an explicitly enabled Windows queue when its runtime is provided.
- The producer must be a job with exactly one instance, so it has no matrix or
  a matrix that expands to one row, and its output must be declared in
  `outputs`. The output value is JSON of at most 1 KiB, the
  [job output limit](#key-limits),
  so a large matrix must stay compact. Rows are objects of scalar values with
  at most 64 properties each; the expansion honours the 256-instance and
  1,024-job limits.
- The deferred uploads of a workflow share the jobs the 1,024-job limit leaves
  after the jobs uploaded up front, in equal parts: with 4 static jobs and 2
  independent deferred components, each component may upload at most 510
  jobs, counting every root's rows and each downstream instance once. The share
  is recorded at upload time, so the deferred steps together cannot grow the
  build past the limit whatever the producers publish. In a chained component
  each stage passes the share it did not use to the next stage. A producer
  output that needs more than the share fails the deferred step before it
  uploads anything, and a share too small for the jobs a deferred step already
  promises fails the workflow with `E_MATRIX_INVALID` at upload time.
- An output that is missing, not JSON, the wrong shape, has zero rows, exceeds a
  limit, or names a runner that fails compilation or admission fails the
  deferred step, and the dependent jobs never run. The step prints the
  compile diagnostics.
- A called workflow with workflow-level `concurrency` can neither hold a
  needs-derived matrix nor need a deferred job. A workflow with its own
  workflow-level `concurrency` cannot
  hold a needs-derived matrix: the group is released when the jobs of the
  initial upload finish, before the jobs a deferred step adds. These fail the
  workflow with `E_MATRIX_INVALID` at upload time.
- The step keys of the deferred step of every stage, of each consumer's
  placeholder, of every statically known instance of a deferred dependent, and
  of the approval gate
  of every environment a deferred job declares are reserved at upload time. A
  key that collides with another job's key or gate, such as a static or
  deferred job `build-matrix` next to a needs-derived matrix `build`, a
  deferred job whose static matrix has duplicate rows, or a job whose id equals
  an approval gate key, fails the workflow with `E_MATRIX_INVALID` before
  anything runs, instead of failing the later upload or letting a job stand in
  for an approval gate. Only the keys the deferred jobs will take are reserved:
  a reusable-workflow job `call.publish` with a matrix does not block a static
  job `call-publish`.
- The deferred step reads the workflow again from a checkout of the build
  commit, so the workflow must be a tracked file inside the repository whose
  content at that commit (`BUILDKITE_COMMIT`, or `HEAD` when the agent did not
  resolve it) is the content the importer compiled. A custom importer that
  uploads one workflow from outside the repository, an untracked or only
  staged file, or a file edited since the commit fails the upload when that
  workflow holds a needs-derived matrix, before anything runs.
- Deferred jobs that deploy to a protected environment use the same approval
  gate as static jobs. When no static job created the gate, the first deferred
  step to upload creates it and later deferred steps reference it. A step whose
  upload was rejected because another step created a shared gate in the
  meantime uploads again, referencing that gate and still creating the gates
  only it uses.
- The importer records the workflow event once per upload, as one artifact
  shared by every deferred step, so many needs-derived matrices do not multiply
  the artifact size.
- When a producer fails, is skipped, or is cancelled, the deferred step uploads
  skipped placeholders for the deferred jobs: one for the consumer, one for
  each matrix a later stage would have expanded, and one per statically known
  matrix instance of each dependent, under the keys and check names a static
  expansion would use. Dependents with `if: always()` are skipped as well;
  this subset does not run descendants of an unknown matrix. In a merged
  component, only that root's downstream jobs are skipped; healthy branches
  still expand, and a shared join is skipped once. In a chained component, a
  producer that does not succeed skips only the jobs from its stage on; the
  jobs earlier stages uploaded stay as they are. Missing or invalid
  result manifests fail the deferred step without uploading jobs, even when
  another producer did not succeed. They are never treated as skips.
- The deferred step recompiles the workflow from the checkout at the build
  commit with the event, variables, runner mappings, OIDC settings, and rows
  of earlier stages the importer or the step before it recorded, and requires
  the result to reproduce the jobs the earlier uploads created, to leave the
  workflow's other deferred matrices exactly as recorded, to defer the next
  stage exactly as the initial upload promised, and to compile every deferred
  job from the workflow source the importer recorded for it: the same file
  content and, for a reusable
  workflow from another repository, the same commit. Any difference, such as a
  reusable-workflow tag that now resolves to another commit, fails the step
  with instructions to retry the whole build.
- The initial upload resolves the actions the deferred jobs use, so an action
  that cannot be resolved fails the workflow before anything runs, and records
  each resolved commit and source digest in the stage record. The deferred
  jobs use those revisions: a public action tag that moves between the initial
  upload and the deferred step does not change them, and a local action whose
  files changed in the checkout fails the step.
- Repository and organization variables are resolved once, at upload time, when
  any job of the workflow reads `vars` in the workflow file or in an action it
  uses, deferred jobs included. The scopes are recorded in the stage record,
  so a deferred job whose action defaults an input to `${{ vars.REGION }}`
  sees the same value a static job would, and the deferred step never
  requests variables itself.
- A workflow that holds a needs-derived matrix is never uploaded job by job.
  When any of its jobs fails compilation, such as a job whose local action is
  missing, the whole workflow is replaced with one failing step,
  `E_PIPELINE_GENERATION` names the deferred jobs, and no job of the workflow
  runs. A per-job upload would keep only the static jobs and drop the deferred
  steps, so the build could pass without them. Without deferred uploads,
  only the failed job is replaced and independent jobs run; see
  [Reusable workflows](#reusable-workflows).
- Retrying the deferred step is safe: a replayed upload is rejected by
  Buildkite because its step keys already exist, and the step then confirms
  the earlier upload. Each later stage re-reads earlier producers' verified
  manifests and compares them with the result digests recorded when their
  matrices expanded. A missing manifest or a changed result, including a new
  attempt with identical output, fails before any upload; it is not a skip.
  Retry the whole build after retrying a producer. See
  [Results, retries, and cancellation](#results-retries-and-cancellation).

The `detail` line of `E_MATRIX_INVALID` says why a reference is not supported.
Matrices derived from `steps` or from anything other than exactly one
`fromJSON(needs.<job>.outputs.<name>)` remain unsupported.

#### Scheduling from matrix-producer outputs

A job whose matrix comes from a producer output can read other declared outputs
of that same ordinary, single-instance producer for scheduling:

```yaml
build:
  needs: plan
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  strategy:
    max-parallel: ${{ fromJSON(needs.plan.outputs.parallel) }}
    matrix:
      include: ${{ fromJSON(needs.plan.outputs.matrix) }}
  steps:
    - run: ./build "${{ matrix.target }}"
```

`parallel` must contain a JSON integer from 1 through 256. The generated limit
applies only to this job's matrix in this Buildkite build. See the complete
[parallelism example](../testdata/scheduling/.github/workflows/parallel.yml).

Alternatively, set `concurrency: ${{ needs.plan.outputs.group }}` on the matrix
job. The group can be a template with direct `needs.<job>.outputs.<name>`
references and supported pure functions, but no other expression contexts.
It must resolve to a nonempty string and uses the same repository-scoped,
case-insensitive group mapping as a static group. All instances use that
group and run one at a time; adding `max-parallel` does not raise this limit.
See the complete [group example](../testdata/scheduling/.github/workflows/group.yml).

The deferred uploader waits for every job in the workflow's initial upload,
not just the producer, before uploading the consumer and its complete
downstream graph. It holds no concurrency slot. This conservative delay avoids
ordered-queue edges blocking unfinished static prerequisites. Missing,
ambiguous, or invalid scheduling outputs fail the deferred upload. Retrying
it verifies the scheduling attributes as well as the job-plan digests.

This support requires a real needs-derived matrix. Scheduling on static
matrices, non-matrix jobs, downstream dependents, or reusable-workflow calls
remains unsupported, as do projected called-workflow outputs and outputs from
other producers. The scheduling consumer's deferred component must have only
one matrix and one expansion stage: it cannot join or chain another
needs-derived matrix. Independent components and components without
output-derived scheduling retain the join and chaining support described above.
Workflow-level concurrency remains rejected, including
called-workflow gates anywhere in the workflow. This slice does not change
gate lifetimes or weaken the early-release rejection above. The existing
retry and cancellation rules still apply; this does not add
`cancel-in-progress` support.

### Containers and services

**🟡 Supported subset.** Linux jobs support job containers and GitHub-compatible services. A typical PostgreSQL service works without Buildkite-specific syntax:

Runner-mapped Buildkite cache volumes are not supported for jobs that set
`container`.

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16
    env:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: test
    ports:
      - 5432
    options: >-
      --health-cmd pg_isready
      --health-interval 2s
      --health-timeout 5s
      --health-retries 10
```

Job containers support `image`, `env`, `ports`, `volumes`, and `options`. Services support `image`, `credentials`, `env`, `ports`, `volumes`, `options`, `command`, and `entrypoint`.

- Job container images can use compile-time `github`, `inputs`, `strategy`, and `matrix` values. A null or exactly empty evaluated image runs the job on the host, including object-form containers, without applying container `env` or `ports`. For example, `container: ${{ matrix.target.container }}` selects host execution when the matrix entry omits `container`. Other results must be strings containing valid image references; whitespace-only results are invalid. Literal images must be non-empty. Secrets, `needs`, step outputs, and whole or dynamic contexts are unsupported.
- Service fields can use compile-time `github`, `inputs`, `strategy`, and `matrix` values or runtime `needs` outputs, including fallback expressions such as `${{ needs.build.outputs.image || 'redis:7' }}`. An empty evaluated image skips the service.
- A complete non-credential service map can use `${{ fromJSON(needs.build.outputs.services || '{}') }}`. The argument supports needs-output expressions and pure functions. Declare credentials statically so the compiler can prove their secret authority.
- Credentials accept values and expressions using `github`, `vars`, `secrets`, `env`, or `needs`, including `${{ needs.auth.outputs.password || secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}`. Prerequisite results and outputs resolve before service setup. Ordinary secrets remain in the job's required inventory even in an unused fallback. Passwords pass to `docker login` through standard input. Authentication uses a private per-job Docker configuration and never reads ambient Docker credentials.
- Job container volumes accept `DESTINATION` for an anonymous volume or `SOURCE:DESTINATION[:ro|rw]` for a named volume or bind mount. `DESTINATION` must be absolute. `SOURCE` must be a Docker volume name or absolute host path. A job can define 128 unique declarations. Expressions are unsupported.
- Job container options pass through to `docker create`, except `--network`, `--net`, and `--entrypoint`, including their `--flag=value` forms. Options split into arguments without a shell. Double quotes group arguments; single quotes are ordinary characters. Expressions, line breaks, NUL bytes, and values over 65,536 bytes are unsupported.
- Service Docker options pass through except `--network` and its `--net` aliases, which GitHub Actions does not support. Options can grant privileges, mount host paths, publish ports, and change resource settings.
- Service named, anonymous, and absolute bind volumes are supported.
- A job can define 32 services. Each service can define 256 environment entries and 128 ports or volumes.

Implicit GHCR authentication is unsupported; provide explicit credentials. Mutable tags resolve at job start. Use a digest when image immutability matters. Job container images must provide `sh` and run the mounted self-contained Linux runtime executable.

Each job uses a private Docker bridge network. Container jobs reach services by service name. Host jobs use declared published ports; omitted host ports are assigned dynamically. The `job.services.<service>` context exposes `id`, `network`, and `ports`.

A service with a Docker health check must become healthy before steps run. A service without one is ready after it starts. Failures include bounded status, health, port, and log diagnostics.

Cleanup removes the job container, emits masked and bounded service logs, then removes services in declaration order, the network, owned volumes, and private Docker configuration. Unless `options` specifies `--volume-driver`, volumes newly created for job `container.volumes` receive a unique ownership label before container creation, so cleanup can recover them after failed or cancelled creation. Pre-existing named volumes retain their labels and are not removed. Docker removes anonymous volumes attached through job `options`, a custom driver, or the image when removing the container. Named volumes supplied only through `options` or created by a custom driver remain because their ownership is ambiguous. Service volumes retain mount-based tracking. Cleanup does not delete unrelated volumes to recover unattributable resources. Remaining owned resources fail the job. Docker resources are not a security or resource-isolation boundary: the hosted queue must isolate the whole job and enforce host CPU, memory, disk, and network limits. See the [security model](security.md#isolate-the-whole-job).

macOS and Windows jobs reject containers, services, Docker actions, and Docker capability.

## Step syntax

### Step configuration

| Key | Status | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name`, `id` | ✅ Supported | Use `id` to read outputs or target background work. IDs must be unique within a job. |
| `if` | 🟡 Supported subset | May use step status, step outputs, `env`, and service ports in addition to job-condition contexts. |
| `env` | 🟡 Supported subset | Values override job and workflow values and may use supported expressions, including fallbacks. |
| `continue-on-error` | ✅ Supported | Accepts literal booleans or expressions that produce a Boolean. A failure records `outcome: failure` and `conclusion: success`, then the job continues. |
| `timeout-minutes` | 🟡 Supported subset | Accepts literal numbers or expressions that produce a number greater than 0 and at most 360. |

A step can continue after failure and expose its outcome to a later condition:

```yaml
- id: test
  run: go test ./...
  continue-on-error: true

- if: steps.test.outcome == 'failure'
  run: ./scripts/report-failure
```

### Commands and actions

**🟡 Supported subset.** Use `bash`, `sh`, `pwsh`, `powershell`, `python`, or a custom shell template on Linux or macOS. Custom templates use `command [options] {0} [more-options]`. The `{0}` placeholder receives a temporary script path. Arguments can use single quotes, double quotes, and backslash escapes. They do not expand shell syntax.

Install the interpreter on the runner or in the job container, and add it to `PATH`. PowerShell, R, and Julia are not installed automatically. Named `pwsh` and `powershell` shells use the corresponding executable without fallback.

Named PowerShell shells run UTF-8 `.ps1` temporary scripts with `$ErrorActionPreference = 'stop'` and propagate the last native command's exit status. PowerShell custom templates receive a `.ps1` script but control their own error behavior. `GITHUB_ENV`, `GITHUB_OUTPUT`, `GITHUB_STATE`, and `GITHUB_PATH` files ignore a leading UTF-8 byte order mark (BOM); BOMs within values remain unchanged.

Windows defaults to `pwsh`; Linux and macOS retain their existing bash default.
`cmd` remains unsupported. If the shell name is known before the job starts, the workflow fails before an agent starts the job. A shell expression that needs a runtime value is checked before its step starts. If it resolves to an unsupported shell, the step fails.

Native Windows executable paths can use drive-absolute backslashes, such as
`D:\cygwin\bin\bash.exe '{0}'`. Quote executable paths containing spaces:
`"C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe" -File {0}`. The runner must provide
the executable at that path. A single backslash after the drive prefix selects
literal separators for the executable only; templates with an escaped first
backslash keep their escape rules. Argument escaping is unchanged.

On Windows, `msys2/setup-msys2@v2` can install the `msys2 {0}` custom shell,
including through `defaults.run.shell`. The runtime resolves its `.cmd` wrapper
from the step's `PATH`, including earlier `GITHUB_PATH` updates. It passes an
extensionless, unmodified script and the Windows working directory to the
wrapper. MSYS2 supplies its login environment, error handling, and path conversion.

Windows `.cmd` custom shells must forward arguments directly, without `CALL`
or delayed expansion. Arguments can contain spaces, single quotes, and
metacharacters such as `%`, `!`, `&`, and `^`. Arguments containing double
quotes, line breaks, NUL, or a trailing backslash are rejected; these limits
do not apply to the script contents. Native executable templates retain their
existing argument handling.

Working directories must stay inside the workspace.

A shell step can specify its shell and workspace-relative working directory:

```yaml
- name: Test
  shell: bash
  working-directory: ./src
  run: go test ./...
```

Use an interpreter installed by an earlier step or included in the job image:

```yaml
- shell: pwsh
  run: '"greeting=héllo" | Out-File -FilePath $env:GITHUB_OUTPUT -Encoding utf8 -Append'

- shell: Rscript {0}
  run: print("R script")

- shell: julia --color=yes {0}
  run: println("Julia script")

- shell: bash -l {0}
  run: conda info
```

A `uses` step may call a supported local or public action. Action inputs under `with` may use supported expressions, including fallbacks. Direct workflow `uses: docker://...` actions are rejected; prebuilt-image declarations belong in locked action metadata.

Local actions must exist in the event repository when the workflow is compiled. An earlier step cannot create a local action with `actions/checkout`, an artifact download, or a command. Use a public `owner/repository/path@ref` action instead.

At execution, local actions require both their action tree and the local workflow bytes to match the plan. Checking out an older commit with a different workflow fails this check even if the action itself is unchanged. `$/` actions do not depend on the checkout and retain their containing source commit.

Action steps can call public and local actions:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v7

- uses: ./.github/actions/build
  with:
    target: production
```

### Self-repository actions

**🟡 Supported subset.** `uses: $/.github/actions/build` downloads the action from the repository and exact commit containing the workflow, without `actions/checkout`. Inside a remote composite action, `$/` selects that action's repository and commit, not the caller's. `uses: $/` selects an action at the repository root. Existing `./` action paths remain checkout-relative.

Inside a remote composite selected with `@v1`, nested `$/` actions expose `v1` as `github.action_ref`, while their source stays pinned to the resolved commit. A `$/` action called directly by a workflow or from a local composite exposes the containing workflow's commit, not its requested branch or tag. The runtime does not populate `GITHUB_ACTION_REF`; pass `github.action_ref` through a step's `env` when a command needs it.

For local workflow input, `compile`, `upload`, and event-specific validation treat the event repository and commit as candidates, not proof of workflow identity. Before resolving `$/`, the compiler fetches the same workflow path at that commit and requires its bytes to match the supplied file. This also applies to self references inside local reusable workflows. A fetched remote reusable workflow supplies its own immutable identity instead. Modified local workflow bytes fail verification; no Git `HEAD` or workspace fallback is used. Synthetic `validate --event` input has no source identity and reports self-repository resolution as indeterminate; use an exact `--event-path` snapshot.

Self-repository actions retain the public-action access boundary, immutable tree verification, capability planning, and nested-action limits. A privately fetched reusable workflow does not grant access to private actions in that tree. Self paths must be repository-relative, without traversal, backslashes, or an explicit `@ref`.

### Background and parallel steps

**✅ Supported.** The `background`, `wait`, `wait-all`, `cancel`, and `parallel` controls are supported. At most ten background steps run at once inside a job. Use `wait: <id>` for selected steps, `wait-all:` for all active work, or `parallel:` for a fixed group.

Background work can be canceled by step ID:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: server
    run: ./scripts/start-server
    background: true

  - run: ./scripts/test

  - cancel: server
```

A parallel group runs a fixed set of child steps together:

```yaml
steps:
  - parallel:
      - run: ./scripts/lint
      - run: ./scripts/test
```

Outputs, environment changes, and failures become visible at the covering wait. Remaining work is joined before post-action cleanup. These controls are not supported inside a composite action.

### Environment files

**✅ Supported.** The runtime supports `GITHUB_OUTPUT`, `GITHUB_ENV`, `GITHUB_PATH`, `GITHUB_STATE`, and `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`. Multiline values are supported. `NODE_OPTIONS` cannot be set through `GITHUB_ENV`.

### Workflow commands

| Command | Status | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `add-mask`, `stop-commands` | ✅ Supported | Standard command behavior. |
| `warning`, `error` | ✅ Supported | Creates Buildkite annotations. |
| `group`, `endgroup` | ✅ Supported | Creates linear log sections. |
| Debug and matcher commands | ➖ Accepted, no effect | Consumed without presentation behavior. |
| `notice`, command echo control, other legacy commands | ❌ Unsupported | Not implemented. |

The total job summary is limited to 1 MiB.

## Expressions and contexts

Three expression modes intentionally support different syntax.

| Syntax | Conditions | Runtime interpolation | Other compile-time expressions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `!`, `&&`, `\|\|`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` | ✅ Supported | 🟡 Listed workflow fields | 🟡 When the result resolves fully |
| `always()`, `success()`, `failure()`, `cancelled()` | ✅ Without arguments | ❌ Unsupported | ❌ Unsupported |
| `startsWith()`, `contains()`, `endsWith()`, `format()`, `join()`, `toJSON()`, `fromJSON()`, `case()` | ✅ Supported | 🟡 Listed workflow fields | 🟡 When the result resolves fully |
| `hashFiles()` | 🟡 Step `if` and action lifecycle conditions | 🟡 Workflow steps only | ❌ Unsupported |

### Conditions

Job and step `if` conditions use GitHub-style:

- truthiness and loose numeric coercion
- case-insensitive string comparison
- operand-returning `&&` and `||`
- primitive conversion for string functions
- array search with `contains()`
- lazy `case()` evaluation with 3–255 odd-numbered arguments and Boolean
  predicates

A missing property in an available `github` or matrix context evaluates to
null. An unavailable context is an error. Unlisted functions are unsupported.
`hashFiles()` accepts 1–255 literal or direct-reference arguments in step and
JavaScript action lifecycle conditions.

Conditions support computed object indexes, numeric array indexes, whole
`matrix` and `needs` objects, step-scoped `steps`, and `.*` projections.

- Missing and out-of-range indexes evaluate to null.
- Projections omit missing children.
- A later wildcard flattens one collection level.
- The equivalent `[*]` spelling is unsupported by the parser.
- Whole or dynamic `github`, except event-rooted access, and whole `inputs` and
  `strategy` remain unsupported.

| Context | Job `if` | Step `if` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `github.actor`, `github.base_ref`, `github.event_name`, `github.head_ref`, `github.ref`, `github.ref_name`, `github.ref_type`, `github.repository`, `github.repository_owner`, `github.sha`, `github.workflow_ref`, `github.workflow_sha` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| `runner.os`, `runner.arch`, `runner.environment` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| `runner.temp` | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| `needs.<job>.result`, `needs.<job>.outputs.<name>` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| `matrix.<name>` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| `vars.<name>` | ✅ Yes, [repository and organization variables](#repository-and-organization-variables) | ✅ Yes, environment over repository over organization variables |
| `inputs.<name>` and computed input indexes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| `steps.<id>.outcome`, `steps.<id>.conclusion`, `steps.<id>.outputs.<name>` | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| `env.<name>` | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| `job.services.<service>.ports[<port>]` | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| `github.event`, including direct, projected, and dynamically indexed properties | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| `secrets` and other contexts | ❌ No | ❌ No |

Before runtime validation, the compiler reduces event-backed conditions from the
immutable snapshot. Resolvable `github.event` expressions become literals.
For whole or runtime-selected event access, the plan retains a marker and
digest for the build's shared event payload artifact.

Every branch is validated first, so short-circuiting cannot hide an unsupported
function, context, or matrix type.

Reusable-workflow call conditions use the same operators and status functions but only the caller contexts listed in [Reusable workflows](#reusable-workflows). The runtime evaluates their ordered guards before the called job's own condition.

### Runtime interpolation

The `||` operator selects its right operand when the left is falsy: `false`,
zero, an empty string, or null. It does not recover from evaluation or
secret-retrieval errors, grant access to an unavailable context, or make a
literal-only field accept expressions. Each field retains its context and
result-type restrictions.

These step fields support the operators and pure functions listed above:

- `run`, `env`, `with`, and `name`
- explicit `shell` and `working-directory`
- `continue-on-error` and `timeout-minutes`

They support computed indexes and projections over available `matrix`,
`inputs`, `env`, `vars`, and `runner` values. `toJSON(needs)` serializes only
direct dependencies, with each job's `result` and `outputs` object (empty when
there are no outputs). Transitive dependencies are not included. Computed and
projected `needs` access and computed, whole, and projected `steps` access
remain unsupported. Reading an unavailable background output is an error.

Before creating a job plan, the compiler resolves scalar `github.event.*`
values and event-dependent parts of otherwise runtime expressions.

Missing event members become null; template interpolation renders null as an
empty string. Event values cannot introduce new `${{ ... }}` regions. A job
that still needs whole, projected, or dynamically indexed `github.event`
access loads the digest-verified event artifact uploaded by the exact importer
job. This preserves the original event for runtime use and retries without
duplicating it across immutable plans. Jobs with an [event file](#event-file)
also load this artifact, even without event expressions.

Job-level expressions support the same operators and pure functions with these field-specific contexts:

| Field | Contexts |
| --- | --- |
| `continue-on-error` | `github`, `needs`, `strategy`, `matrix`, `vars`, `inputs` |
| `env` | `github`, `needs`, `matrix`, `vars`, `secrets`, `inputs` |
| `defaults.run` | `github`, `needs`, `matrix`, `env`, `vars`, `inputs` |
| `outputs` | `github`, `needs`, `matrix`, `job`, `runner`, `env`, `vars`, `secrets`, `steps`, `inputs` |

Workflow-level `env` values use the job `env` expression rules, including
fallbacks such as `${{ github.head_ref || github.ref_name }}`. Workflow-level
`defaults.run` remains limited to direct context references.

Workflow step fields support `hashFiles()`; composite step and job-level fields
do not. Composite action `run`, `env`, `with`, and `working-directory` fields do
support the listed operators and pure functions.

Outside `continue-on-error`, the runtime has no equivalent value for
`strategy`. Job outputs support service IDs, networks, and published ports
through `job.services`, such as `${{ job.services.redis.ports[6379] }}`;
other `job` fields remain unsupported. The listed job-level fields also
support `toJSON(needs)`, with the same direct-dependency scope and access
restrictions as step fields.

Expression-valued `continue-on-error` must produce a Boolean. Expression-valued `timeout-minutes` must produce a number greater than 0 and at most 360.

Direct `github.token` references are step-only. Step runtime fields also support
the exact, case-insensitive call `toJSON(github)`. It serializes the retained
context listed below, including `token`, with sorted keys and two-space
indentation.

The compiler treats that call as a token reference, so normal permissions,
admission, and redaction apply. Composite steps can consume an already
authorized context, but composite metadata cannot grant token authority. A
tokenless context is an error.

Job-level fields and action input defaults cannot call `toJSON(github)`. Bare,
projected, or dynamically indexed `github`, and passing the whole context to
another function, remain unsupported. These limits do not apply to access
rooted at `github.event`.

`runner.os` and `runner.arch` resolve to `Linux`/`X64`, `macOS`/`ARM64`, or
`Windows`/`X64`.
`runner.environment` resolves to `self-hosted`. GitHub assigns this value to
runners registered outside GitHub, including managed providers. Buildkite
agents are in the same class whether they use hosted agents or your own
infrastructure.
After runner setup, step runtime fields and job outputs can also use
`runner.temp`, which resolves to the canonical temporary directory exposed as
`RUNNER_TEMP`. Other runner fields and compile-time positions that require
runner identity are unsupported. Action metadata input defaults may also use
direct `runner.debug`, which resolves to the string `false` because Buildkite
has no equivalent step-debug mode. `job.check_run_id` defaults, including the
static indexed spelling, resolve to an empty string because Buildkite does not
create a GitHub check run. Other `job` identity fields remain unsupported.

A runtime interpolation can read a verified upstream output directly:

```yaml
run: echo "${{ needs.build.outputs.image }}"
```

The runtime retains this bounded `github` context:

| Fields | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `actor`, `event_name`, `ref`, `repository`, `sha` | Event identity from the compiled plan. |
| `repository_owner` | Derived from `repository`. |
| `server_url` | Identifies the event repository provider. |
| `job` | Workflow job ID. |
| `workflow` | Workflow name, or its path when unnamed. |
| `head_ref`, `base_ref` | Pull request source and target branches; empty for other events. |
| `ref_name` | Ref without `refs/heads/`, `refs/tags/`, or `refs/pull/`. Pull request refs use `<number>/merge` or `<number>/head`. |
| `ref_type` | `branch` for branch and pull request refs; `tag` for tag refs. SHA-only `deployment` and `deployment_status` events also use `branch`, while `ref` and `ref_name` remain empty. |
| `action_path` | Composite action directory inside composite steps; empty elsewhere. |
| `action_repository`, `action_ref` | Remote composite repository and requested ref; empty for local composites and outside composite steps. |
| `workspace` | The workspace directory: the fixed job-container mount for container jobs, the host checkout directory otherwise. Exposed as `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`. |
| `run_id`, `run_number`, `run_attempt` | Buildkite build identity: the build ID, the build number, and the retry count plus one. Exposed as `GITHUB_RUN_ID`, `GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER`, and `GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT`. Referencing them outside a Buildkite build is an error, and GitHub run URLs or API calls built from them do not resolve because no GitHub Actions run exists. |
| `token` | Available only in an authorized step expression. |
| `event` | The immutable, digest-verified event payload, loaded for runtime event expressions or an [event file](#event-file). |

This is not the full GitHub context.

`hashFiles()` evaluates when its step field is consumed, so it sees files from
earlier steps such as checkout. A JavaScript action's `with` and `env` can be
evaluated for `pre`, then evaluated again for `main`.

Patterns apply in order. `!` excludes matches; a later positive pattern can add
them back. Directory matches include descendants, hidden files match normally,
and overlapping patterns hash each path once. Matching is case-insensitive only
on Windows. An empty match returns an empty string.

On Linux, literal paths use direct lookups. macOS and Windows enumerate directory
names to preserve platform-specific matching. Each positive pattern searches
below its literal directory prefix, then walks recursively from its first
wildcard. For example, `packages/service/*.go` searches under `packages/service`,
while `packages/s*/value` searches under `packages`. Negative patterns filter
matches but do not prune traversal, since later patterns can re-include files.
The entry limit counts inspected entries, including nonmatches, rather than the
size of the workspace.

Each call has an execution budget covering traversal, matching, sorting, hashing,
and verification. An earlier step or job deadline still applies. Cancellation is
checked between operations; it cannot interrupt a blocked filesystem call.
Entry-limit and execution-budget errors list the positive patterns being searched
and recommend more specific paths to reduce traversal and hashing. The budget is
shared across those patterns.

For each file, `hashFiles()` calculates SHA-256 over its contents. It then hashes
the concatenated binary digests in lexical path order. GitHub Runner does not
specify glob traversal order, so a multi-file digest can differ when GitHub's
order is not lexical.

Patterns cannot be absolute or contain `..` segments or ASCII control
characters. Hashing stays inside the workspace and does not enter symlinked
directories. A matched symlink or other non-regular file fails the step.

GitHub Runner can hash a file symlink and has an optional symlink-following
mode. This runtime deliberately does neither.

### Event file

When upload receives a linked webhook or an explicit `--event-path` snapshot,
`GITHUB_EVENT_PATH` points to a job-scoped JSON file containing its complete
`payload` object, not the snapshot wrapper. JSON formatting may differ from the
original. The reduced fallback synthesized from Buildkite environment variables
does not create this file.

The file is available to shell steps, JavaScript pre/main/post hooks, nested
composites, and Docker actions. Job containers and Docker actions receive a
read-only mount with a container-local path. The file lives outside the checkout
and writable runner temp, survives through post hooks, and is removed at job
teardown. Job and step environment overrides cannot replace the runtime path.
`github.event_path` expressions are not supported.

```yaml
- run: jq -e '.issue.number == 42' "$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH" >/dev/null
```

Event retention follows the [event payload security boundary](security.md#source-and-event-checks).

### Compile-time expressions

Matrices, runner labels, names, concurrency groups, retained runtime templates,
and event-backed conditions can use statically known `github`, `event`, and
matrix values.

Compile-time `github` fields are `actor`, `base_ref`, `event_name`, `head_ref`,
`ref`, `ref_name`, `ref_type`, `repository`, `repository_owner`, `sha`, and
`workflow`. Expressions can use computed indexes, numeric array indexes, and
`.*` projections when the complete result resolves during compilation.

Whole or dynamic `github` access remains unsupported unless it is rooted at
`github.event`. Event-backed runtime expressions can combine reducible event
parts with values supported by their runtime surface. Action references in
`uses` must remain static and cannot use `github.event`.

## Actions

### Action sources and runtimes

| Action type | Status | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local `./...` action | 🟡 Supported subset | Source tree is digest-locked and reverified. |
| Public `owner/repo[/path]@ref` action | 🟡 Supported subset | Resolved to an exact commit and digest. |
| Private action | ❌ Unsupported | No private action source access. |
| JavaScript action | ✅ Supported | Declares `node16`, `node20`, or `node24`. |
| Composite action | 🟡 Supported subset | Nested shell steps and locked local or public actions; [supported shells](#commands-and-actions), including expression-backed custom templates, for `run`; literal `continue-on-error`. |
| Docker action | 🟡 Supported subset | Verified local or public Dockerfile or prebuilt-image action on Linux with optional bounded `runs.args`. Rejected on macOS and Windows, including through a composite action. |
| Direct workflow `uses: docker://...` action | ❌ Unsupported | Rejected during validation. |
| Top-level action metadata `env` | ➖ Accepted, no effect | Any valid YAML value is discarded. It is not evaluated, injected, retained in plans, or used to request secrets or tokens. |

Mutable public refs are resolved during upload, then locked to a commit. The importer lazily requests one Buildkite action-source token and reuses it across all workflow roots and nested composite actions. This token authenticates only public metadata requests for repositories other than the credential repository; the credential repository and codeload requests remain anonymous. If token issuance is unavailable during rollout, resolution safely falls back to anonymous GitHub API access. Exact lowercase commit SHAs need no GitHub API lookup. Complete source trees are verified again at runtime.

Authenticated resolution shares successful repository visibility checks within
each compilation. Later compilations recheck visibility when resolving uncached
refs. When GitHub rate-limits requests, the resolver suppresses new API requests
against the affected authenticated or anonymous budget until the retry deadline,
or for one minute if GitHub supplies none. Already running requests may finish;
cached refs and exact commit pins remain usable. Rate-limit suppression stays
local to that resolver and is not written to source caches.

Within a compilation, repeated missing refs reuse the same failure after all
required API lookups return HTTP 404. Authentication, network, server, and
cancellation failures are not cached as missing. Permitted Git fallback still
runs. Later compilations retry missing refs, and every affected action keeps
its diagnostic.

Nested calls from a repository-local composite must be local. Public composites may call local children or other public actions; every child is resolved and locked.

Prebuilt-image actions declare `docker://` in action metadata, not in a
workflow step:

```yaml
# action.yml
name: Check formatting
inputs:
  path:
    default: .
runs:
  using: docker
  image: docker://ghcr.io/example/formatter@sha256:0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
  entrypoint: /usr/local/bin/formatter
  args:
    - ${{ inputs.path }}
```

```yaml
# .github/workflows/check.yml
steps:
  - uses: example/formatter-action@v2
    with:
      path: .
```

The compiler locks the action source that declares the image. At job start,
the runtime pulls each declared image anonymously through an empty private
Docker configuration. Action metadata has no registry-credential field, so
private images and ambient Docker credentials are unsupported. Digest
references are supported. Mutable tags resolve when the job starts and can
drift between jobs; use a digest when image immutability matters.

Direct workflow syntax such as `uses: docker://alpine:3.20` remains
unsupported. It does not have the locked action-source provenance used by
metadata-declared images.

Dockerfile actions require exact `runs.image: Dockerfile`. Optional `runs.args`
must be an ordered YAML string array. Each item becomes one argument after the
image name, without a shell. Empty strings, whitespace, and shell metacharacters
remain literal. Omitted or empty args keep the image `CMD`; any non-empty array
replaces `CMD` while preserving the image `ENTRYPOINT`. A prebuilt-image
action's optional `runs.entrypoint` overrides the image `ENTRYPOINT`.

Args may contain literals and expressions using action `inputs`, operators,
and the supported pure functions, such as `${{ inputs.name || 'default' }}`.
Other contexts, credentials, status functions, and `hashFiles()` are rejected,
including in unreachable branches. Invocation inputs and metadata defaults
resolve before args evaluation; substituted values remain literal arguments.
The compiler stores args as action-authored sites in the
normalized job program. Runtime verifies the locked action tree but does not
reparse its metadata.

Dockerfile actions cannot declare explicit entrypoints. Docker actions cannot
declare pre/post lifecycle or request credentials, volumes, arbitrary options,
or privileged mode. An arg such as `--privileged` remains a container argument;
it cannot become a Docker option.

Action metadata parsing remains strict for every other unknown top-level field and for unknown nested fields. The inert top-level `env` exception does not replace workflow or action-step environments, populate `runs.env`, or add `GITHUB_TOKEN` authority.

| Action declaration | Runtime |
| --- | --- |
| `node16` | Managed Node 16.20.2, with one end-of-job deprecation warning. |
| `node20` | Managed Node 24.18.0. |
| `node24` | Managed Node 24.18.0. |

Pre, main, and post phases; inputs; outputs; state; and LIFO post ordering are supported. Other Node declarations are rejected.

JavaScript action `pre-if` and `post-if` metadata uses the condition operators, status functions, pure functions, and `hashFiles()` described in [Conditions](#conditions). Lifecycle conditions can read direct properties from workflow `inputs`, `env`, `github`, `job.services`, `matrix`, `runner`, and `steps`, and direct or dynamic `github.event` properties. Other contexts and dynamic or whole-context access return an error. An empty lifecycle condition always runs and does not receive an implicit `success()` guard.

Pre conditions use the status and action-scoped environment available when preparation reaches the action. Post conditions run during job teardown and use the final job status and environment, including `GITHUB_ENV` changes from main. Root action posts also see final workflow step state. Nested composite actions retain their isolated step context. Cancellation remains distinct from failure, and posts keep LIFO order.

### Checkout action

**🟡 Supported subset.** Immutable commits captured from frozen upstream tags, `main`, `master`, and `releases/v1` through `releases/v6` snapshots are admitted. The snapshot includes historical development and release commits across v1 through v7. These known releases identify the principal contracts:

| v7.0.1 | [`3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1`](https://github.com/actions/checkout/tree/3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1) |

Every resolved immutable commit uses the native adapter; the upstream JavaScript doesn't run. Commits in the frozen snapshots retain their exact inputs, full-history default, and outputs. For example, early v2 commits reject later v2 inputs, and v4.0 and v4.1 commits don't expose the `ref` and `commit` outputs.

An immutable commit absent from the snapshots uses the stable v7.0.1 contract as a compatibility fallback. Compilation emits one `W_CHECKOUT_UNKNOWN_COMMIT_FALLBACK` warning for each distinct unknown commit. This higher-risk fallback can differ from the commit's upstream manifest, but it doesn't widen the native adapter: repository, ref, path, credentials, and every other input still use the restrictions below. Known snapshotted commits never use the fallback. Compilation emits `W_CHECKOUT_LEGACY_RELEASE` for v1.2.0 and v2.8.0 to nudge an upgrade to v4 or later.

Maintainers can refresh the frozen refs and per-commit profiles with `go generate ./internal/action/integration`. Regeneration gives exact profiles only to commits reachable from the selected upstream tags and branches at that time. Other valid resolved SHAs continue to use the fallback.

Buildkite runs v1.2.0 like v1 and v2.8.0 like v2, and warns about their differences from v4 and later. Neither release sets the `ref` or `commit` outputs added in v4.2.0. v1.2.0 also fetches full history by default when `fetch-depth` is omitted. Upgrade only if your workflow needs those outputs or different v1 history behavior. Otherwise, keep the current version.

The adapter checks out a detached commit or static branch from the event repository at the workspace root or a clean nested directory. It uses Buildkite repository-provider Git credentials when the job provides them; otherwise, it fetches anonymously. Credentials are scoped to the Git commands that fetch repository, LFS, or submodule data and are never persisted.

An explicit input is accepted only when the exact snapshotted contract declares it, or when the v7.0.1 fallback contract declares it for an unknown commit. The following value restrictions then apply:

| Input | Supported values |
| --- | --- |
| `repository` | Omitted, or the event `owner/repo`. |
| `ref` | Omitted, empty, a lowercase 40-hex commit, or a static branch in the event repository. A direct `github.sha` or `needs.<job>.outputs.<name>` expression must resolve at runtime to the exact event SHA. |
| `token` | Omitted only. |
| `ssh-key`, `ssh-known-hosts` | When declared by the commit: omitted or empty. Otherwise omitted. |
| `ssh-strict` | When declared by the commit: omitted or `true`. Otherwise omitted. |
| `ssh-user` | When declared by the commit: omitted or `git`. Otherwise omitted. |
| `persist-credentials` | When declared by the commit: omitted or `false`. Otherwise omitted. |
| `path` | Omitted, empty, or a clean relative directory without a `.git` path segment. The resolved path stays inside the workspace and can't traverse symbolic-link parents. |
| `clean` | Omitted, `true`, or `false`; the root workspace must be empty, or the selected path must be absent. Existing-directory reuse is unsupported, so `false` differs only by matching workflows that select a fresh target. |
| `filter` | When declared by the commit: omitted, empty, or one Git partial-clone filter without control characters. Otherwise omitted. |
| `sparse-checkout` | When declared by the commit: omitted, empty, or up to 1,000 non-empty patterns totaling at most 1 MiB. Otherwise omitted. |
| `sparse-checkout-cone-mode` | When declared by the commit: omitted, `true`, or `false`. Otherwise omitted. |
| `fetch-depth` | Omitted or a nonnegative integer; `0` fetches full history. Historical runner-plugin commits fetch full history when omitted. |
| `fetch-tags` | When declared by the commit: omitted, `true`, or `false`. Otherwise omitted. |
| `show-progress` | When declared by the commit: omitted, `true`, or `false`. Otherwise omitted. |
| `lfs` | Omitted, `true`, or `false`. `true` requires Git LFS in the job image. |
| `submodules` | Omitted, `false`, `true`, or `recursive`; whitespace is trimmed and casing is ignored. |
| `set-safe-directory` | When declared by the commit: omitted or `true`. Otherwise omitted. |
| `github-server-url` | When declared by the commit: omitted, empty, or `https://github.com`. Otherwise omitted. |
| `allow-unsafe-pr-checkout` | When declared by the commit: omitted or `false`. Otherwise omitted. |

The `ref` and `commit` outputs are available when the selected exact or fallback contract declares them. Exact contracts follow each commit's action manifest; the v7.0.1 fallback exposes both outputs. Upstream added both outputs in v4.2.0.

The `false` value and omission do not run submodule commands. The `true` value runs native Git for direct children, and `recursive` includes nested children. Relative URLs and `fetch-depth` follow native Git behavior. Public and private GitHub submodules are supported under the job's repository access; external HTTPS submodules are anonymous. `git@github.com:` URLs are rewritten to HTTPS. Other SSH and non-HTTPS transports are unsupported.

Sparse checkout applies `blob:none` automatically unless `filter` is explicit. Cone mode treats each line as a directory. Non-cone mode uses Git ignore-style patterns. LFS configures repository-local filters before fetch without installing push or locking hooks. A regular checkout fetches the selected revision's LFS objects before checkout; sparse checkout lets Git LFS download only materialized paths.

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v7
  with:
    path: sources/application
    filter: blob:limit=1m
    fetch-depth: 20
    show-progress: false

- uses: actions/checkout@v7
  with:
    path: sources/docs
    sparse-checkout: |
      docs
      schemas

- uses: actions/checkout@v7
  with:
    lfs: true
    sparse-checkout: |
      /*.md
      /assets/
      !/assets/archive/
    sparse-checkout-cone-mode: false
```

See the [security model](security.md#checkout-and-submodules) for credential, Git, and job-isolation boundaries.

Alternate repositories, tags, non-event dynamic commits, GitHub Enterprise Server, credential persistence, and existing-directory reuse remain unsupported. Commit and branch checkouts remain detached and confined to the event repository.

### Upload artifact action

**🟡 Supported subset.** Resolved commits in the frozen upstream release and `main` snapshots use a native Buildkite ZIP adapter. These principal releases remain named compatibility points:

| Release | Commit |
| --- | --- |
| v1.0.0 | [`3446296876d12d4e3a0f3145a3c87e67bf0a16b5`](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/tree/3446296876d12d4e3a0f3145a3c87e67bf0a16b5) |
| v2.3.1 | [`82c141cc518b40d92cc801eee768e7aafc9c2fa2`](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/tree/82c141cc518b40d92cc801eee768e7aafc9c2fa2) |
| v3.2.1 | [`ff15f0306b3f739f7b6fd43fb5d26cd321bd4de5`](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/tree/ff15f0306b3f739f7b6fd43fb5d26cd321bd4de5) |
| v4.6.0 | [`65c4c4a1ddee5b72f698fdd19549f0f0fb45cf08`](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/tree/65c4c4a1ddee5b72f698fdd19549f0f0fb45cf08) |
| v4.6.2 | [`ea165f8d65b6e75b540449e92b4886f43607fa02`](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/tree/ea165f8d65b6e75b540449e92b4886f43607fa02) |
| v5.0.0 | [`330a01c490aca151604b8cf639adc76d48f6c5d4`](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/tree/330a01c490aca151604b8cf639adc76d48f6c5d4) |
| v6.0.0 | [`b7c566a772e6b6bfb58ed0dc250532a479d7789f`](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/tree/b7c566a772e6b6bfb58ed0dc250532a479d7789f) |
| v7.0.1 | [`043fb46d1a93c77aae656e7c1c64a875d1fc6a0a`](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/tree/043fb46d1a93c77aae656e7c1c64a875d1fc6a0a) |

Each snapshotted commit retains the inputs, outputs, hidden-file default, and v1 path behavior declared by its upstream contract. For example, v4.0.0 accepts `compression-level` but rejects the later `overwrite` and `include-hidden-files` inputs, and exposes `artifact-id` without the later `artifact-digest`. The v3.2.2 and v3.2.2-node20 commits remain unsupported because upstream publishes them only as GitHub Enterprise Server security backports and deprecates them on github.com.

An immutable commit absent from the snapshot uses the stable v7.0.1 contract as a compatibility fallback. Compilation emits one `W_UPLOAD_ARTIFACT_UNKNOWN_COMMIT_FALLBACK` warning for each distinct unknown commit. The fallback can differ from the commit's upstream manifest, but it does not widen the native adapter or execute upstream JavaScript. Malformed commits remain unsupported. Compilation emits `W_UPLOAD_ARTIFACT_LEGACY_RELEASE` for the principal v1 through v3 releases to recommend v4 or later.

Maintainers can refresh the frozen tags, branches, and per-commit profiles with `go generate ./internal/action/integration`. Regeneration records only manifests whose inputs and outputs fit the bounded adapter. Other valid resolved SHAs continue to use the fallback.

| Input | Supported values |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Required by v1 runner-plugin contracts. Later contracts default to `artifact`. |
| `path` | Required. v1 runner-plugin contracts accept one literal file or directory. Later contracts accept literal paths or bounded `*`, `?`, character-class, and `**` file globs. |
| `if-no-files-found` | When declared: `warn`, `error`, or `ignore`. The v1 runner-plugin contract fails when its literal path is missing and uploads an empty existing directory. |
| `retention-days` | When declared: nonnegative integer; advisory only. |
| `compression-level` | When declared: `0` through `9`. |
| `overwrite` | When declared: omitted or `false`. |
| `include-hidden-files` | When declared: GitHub Actions boolean, default `false`. Earlier contracts without this input retain hidden paths. |
| `archive` | When declared: omitted or `true`. |

Native jobs accept workspace-relative or absolute paths on the execution platform, including Windows drive paths such as `C:\build\dist\*.zip`. An absolute glob such as `/tmp/baipp/dist/*` archives paths relative to its literal search root (`package.whl`, not `tmp/baipp/dist/package.whl`). Multiple selections use their least common ancestor as the archive root.

Job-container uploads require workspace-relative paths. The native adapter rejects absolute paths at runtime rather than interpreting a container path in the host filesystem. This restriction does not apply to native jobs that only use service containers.

Unsupported path forms include exclusions, symlinks, traversal, UNC and drive-relative paths, alternate data streams, braces, extglobs, leading glob comments, and special files. Selections on different Windows volumes cannot share an archive root. At most 32 path roots may be selected. Contracts that declare `include-hidden-files` exclude hidden path segments unless explicitly enabled.

An artifact may contain at most 10,000 files. `buildkite-gha` does not impose a source or ZIP byte limit; the Buildkite Agent and configured artifact storage enforce their limits. A job may publish 64 artifacts.

Downloads verify the recorded archive size and digest before staging every member. File-count, path, format, and filesystem limits protect extraction; there is no separate fixed expansion-byte policy.

The adapter sets `artifact-id` and `artifact-digest` only when the snapshotted or fallback contract declares them. `artifact-url` remains empty because no GitHub run-scoped URL exists. Merge, raw upload, overwrite, and effective retention control are unsupported.

### Download artifact action

**🟡 Supported subset.** These root `actions/download-artifact` actions use the same producer-bound ZIP mode:

| Release | Commit |
| --- | --- |
| v4.3.0 | [`d3f86a106a0bac45b974a628896c90dbdf5c8093`](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact/tree/d3f86a106a0bac45b974a628896c90dbdf5c8093) |
| v5.0.0 | [`634f93cb2916e3fdff6788551b99b062d0335ce0`](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact/tree/634f93cb2916e3fdff6788551b99b062d0335ce0) |
| v6.0.0 | [`018cc2cf5baa6db3ef3c5f8a56943fffe632ef53`](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact/tree/018cc2cf5baa6db3ef3c5f8a56943fffe632ef53) |
| v7.0.0 | [`37930b1c2abaa49bbe596cd826c3c89aef350131`](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact/tree/37930b1c2abaa49bbe596cd826c3c89aef350131) |
| v8.0.0 | [`70fc10c6e5e1ce46ad2ea6f2b72d43f7d47b13c3`](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact/tree/70fc10c6e5e1ce46ad2ea6f2b72d43f7d47b13c3) |
| v8.0.1 | [`3e5f45b2cfb9172054b4087a40e8e0b5a5461e7c`](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact/tree/3e5f45b2cfb9172054b4087a40e8e0b5a5461e7c) |

An unknown lowercase 40-hex immutable commit uses the stable v8.0.1 contract as a compatibility fallback. Compilation emits one `W_DOWNLOAD_ARTIFACT_UNKNOWN_COMMIT_FALLBACK` warning for each distinct unknown commit. The fallback can differ from the commit's upstream manifest, but it does not widen the native adapter or execute upstream JavaScript. Malformed commits remain unsupported.

| Input | Supported values |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Exact name, mutually exclusive with `pattern`; runtime expressions are allowed. |
| `pattern` | Bounded artifact-name glob; requires `merge-multiple: true`; runtime expressions are allowed. |
| `path` | Optional literal workspace-relative path. |
| `merge-multiple` | Omitted or `false` with `name`; required `true` with `pattern`. |
| v8 `skip-decompress` | Omitted or `false`. |
| v8 `digest-mismatch` | Omitted or `error`. |

Artifacts must come from verified direct `needs` producers. Exact-name lookup must find one unique artifact. A bounded pattern may select and deterministically merge up to 64 distinct names. The shipped pattern contract accepts `*`, `?`, character classes, and `**`. Brace alternation remains unsupported pending hosted proof.

When artifacts contain the same exact member path, the later artifact by name wins. All matched archives are validated and staged before the destination changes. Artifact ID, all-artifact, cross-run, cross-repository, raw, REST, and non-merged pattern modes are unsupported.

Only ZIPs produced by the supported upload adapter are accepted. Digest or ZIP validation failure is fatal. The `download-path` output is supported.

### Cache action

Workflow-level and job-level `cache-mode` accept exactly `read`, `write`,
`write-only`, and `none`. Jobs inherit the workflow mode unless they override
it. For example, workflow `cache-mode: write` with job `cache-mode: read`
selects read-only client behavior for that job. Modes on reusable-workflow
calls or in workflows declaring `workflow_call` are not supported.

The compiled plan carries the effective mode. JavaScript action pre, main,
and post phases receive it as `ACTIONS_CACHE_MODE`, overriding workflow or
action environment values. Omitting both keys preserves existing behavior;
the runtime does not choose a trigger-based default.

| Mode | Client restore | Client save |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `read` | Allowed | Skipped |
| `write` | Allowed | Allowed |
| `write-only` | Skipped | Allowed |
| `none` | Skipped | Skipped |

This is **best-effort client behavior, not a security boundary**. It does not
change cache-token issuance or widen the server's existing provenance-based
authorization. Direct service requests remain subject to that authorization,
not the requested mode. Clients that ignore `ACTIONS_CACHE_MODE` do not apply
these additional restrictions.

The audited [upstream commit `3edfce9`](https://github.com/actions/cache/commit/3edfce9056124e459a23f683a21433670d47daca)
bundles `@actions/cache` 6.2.0, which logs and skips disallowed operations.
The v6.1.0 release listed below and older bundled clients ignore the variable.
A skipped restore is a cache miss, so `fail-on-cache-miss: true` can still
fail the action. Docker actions do not receive the compiled mode.

**🟡 Supported subset.** Immutable commits captured from frozen upstream tags and the `main` and `releases/v5` branches are admitted when their root, `restore`, and `save` bundles all speak the cache-v2 protocol the Buildkite Results service implements. The snapshot covers historical development and release commits from v3.4.0 and v4.2.0 onward, including untagged `main` commits. The admitted release commits run their stock cache-v2 clients; these principal releases are named in diagnostics:

The v3 releases use managed Node 16 and emit its standard deprecation warning. Node 20 declarations run with managed Node 24. Every admitted bundle selects cache v2 from `ACTIONS_CACHE_SERVICE_V2`, uses `ACTIONS_RESULTS_URL` and a job-scoped runtime token, and preserves the root restore/post-save lifecycle and separate entry points. A non-routable `ACTIONS_CACHE_URL` satisfies the legacy availability gate; cache traffic still uses `ACTIONS_RESULTS_URL`. Their tar with zstd-or-gzip archive versioning is compatible across releases.

On experimental Windows jobs, cache actions use a restricted tool path:
`Git\usr\bin` and `zstd` under the Windows Program Files directory, then
Windows System32. Install Git for Windows and zstd there for GNU tar with zstd
compression. Without zstd, the upstream client uses gzip; without Git's tar,
it can use Windows System32 tar. Cross-OS archives require GNU tar and zstd.
The runtime obtains installation paths from Windows, replaces tool-selection
environment variables case-insensitively, and excludes workflow `PATH` and
`GITHUB_PATH` additions. Keep these installation directories outside workflow
write access. This does not enable Buildkite cache volumes.

The snapshot admits a commit only when every bundle it runs selects cache v2 and embeds one `@actions/cache` client version of 4.0.0 or later. Commits before v3.4.0 and v4.2.0 bundle cache-v1 clients and are absent. v3.4.1 is snapshotted but excluded because [its upstream release warns that it was published with an incorrect SHA](https://github.com/actions/cache/releases/tag/v3.4.1).

A resolved commit outside the snapshot does not run. `actions/cache` runs upstream JavaScript with a job-scoped cache token, so an unaudited bundle could act on the cache service. Instead, the compiler runs the newest principal release for the requested major version (`v5` or `v5.2.0` runs v5.1.0), or v6.1.0 when the ref names no admitted major, a branch, or a bare commit. The plan records the requested ref and the substitute commit, and compilation emits one `W_CACHE_UNKNOWN_COMMIT_SUBSTITUTED` warning per distinct resolved commit:

```text
actions/cache@v6 resolved to commit <resolved-commit>, which is not in the frozen actions/cache snapshot admitted to the Buildkite cache-v2 service. The audited v6.1.0 release (55cc8345863c7cc4c66a329aec7e433d2d1c52a9) runs instead. Pin actions/cache@55cc8345863c7cc4c66a329aec7e433d2d1c52a9 to remove this warning.
```

The substitute must resolve to its recorded commit, or compilation fails. Substitution keeps floating `v3` through `v6` refs working when upstream publishes a release after the last regeneration, and it also covers pre-cache-v2 releases, withdrawn v3.4.1, and pinned unknown commits. The substitute is a different upstream bundle from the one requested, so pin a listed commit to run an exact release. Maintainers refresh the frozen refs and per-commit profiles with `go generate ./internal/action/integration`.

Hosted runtime proof covers v6.1.0 and a v3.4.0 producer with a v6.1.0
consumer. [Build 1173](https://buildkite.com/buildkite/buildkite-gha/builds/1173)
(Buildkite access required) saved a unique v3 archive, restored it with v6, and
verified the payload. Hosted validation checks resolution, compilation, and
admission for every listed commit; it does not execute the actions.

JavaScript and Docker actions with compatible bundled cache clients also receive job-bound cache-v2 credentials when the service is available. Root invocations of `actions/setup-node`, `actions/setup-java`, `actions/setup-python`, `actions/setup-go`, and `actions/setup-dotnet` use a subprocess-scoped synthetic `GITHUB_SERVER_URL` when the real host would make their clients select cache v1. Each allowlist entry requires an audit of the action source and bundled dependencies to confirm that `GITHUB_SERVER_URL` affects only caching behavior and is not load-bearing for any request the action makes. The workflow expression context retains the real server URL. Ordinary `run` steps and native action adapters do not receive cache credentials.

## Repositories, credentials, and GitHub services

### Repositories

| Source | Status | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public GitHub event repository | ✅ Supported | No additional boundary. |
| Private GitHub event repository | 🟡 Supported subset | Buildkite must authorize repository-provider Git credentials. |
| Internal or private Origin event repository | 🟡 Supported subset | `BUILDKITE_REPO` must be the pipeline's exact `https://origin.cursor.com/git/<namespace>/<repository>.git` URL. Buildkite must authorize repository-provider Git credentials. |
| Alternate repository in `actions/checkout` | ❌ Unsupported | Not available. |
| Public GitHub action | 🟡 Supported subset | Subject to the action boundaries above. |
| Private reusable workflow | 🟡 Supported subset | Same-repository or explicitly approved cross-repository source. Resolved by the importer only. |
| Private action | ❌ Unsupported | No private action source access. |
| GitHub Enterprise Server or an unlisted provider | ❌ Unsupported | Not available. |

### GitHub token

**🟡 Supported subset.** A job requests one short-lived `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the
event repository when it:

- statically references `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` or `github.token`; or
- uses an action whose effective input default can reach `github.token` for the
  event provider.

A `github.server_url == 'https://github.com'` guard skips the token branch for
an Origin repository. Native adapters ignore upstream input defaults, so
`actions/checkout` alone does not request a token.

The top-level workflow's `permissions` set the scope. Token issuance needs a
Buildkite organization feature and a pipeline setting; both are off by default.

Buildkite reads that policy from the pipeline repository at the immutable build
commit. The workflow must be a simple `.yml` or `.yaml` file directly under
`.github/workflows/`.

- Omitted permissions mean exactly `contents: read`.
- GitHub repository and organization defaults are not inherited.
- `read-all` and `write-all` become explicit 13-scope maps.
- Write access needs an explicit, non-empty top-level map.
- An empty map, or scopes that all resolve to `none`, creates no token.
- Job-level repository permission maps do not change the scope.

Compilation warns when job permissions differ from the applied top-level map.
Server support for each immutable source policy must be deployed before a
client that compiles the corresponding alias.

Reusable-workflow jobs receive the requesting workflow's top-level repository
permissions. Buildkite does not inspect called-workflow maps for `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
so those maps cannot narrow it. The separate `id-token` permission still
supports called-workflow narrowing. Compilation warns when a called policy
would have narrowed the repository token.

Pull requests and their triggered or rebuilt descendants have a `contents: read`
ceiling. Merge-queue builds and their descendants cannot request a token. GitHub
Enterprise Server is unsupported. The backend verifies provenance and remains
authoritative.

A job can request read-only repository access:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  inspect:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}
```

The server restricts pull requests, merge queues, and their descendants. For other builds, job binding does not establish that an arbitrary commit is trusted. Restrict who can create builds and enable write tokens only when branch builds run trusted code.

The token is not part of the initial job environment. Workflow-authored
`github.token` references are step-only and use the same token as
`secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`. Effective action input defaults can also use it.
Automatic ambient `GITHUB_TOKEN` is unsupported.

### Other secrets and OIDC

**🟡 Supported subset.** Direct jobs can use static `${{ secrets.NAME }}`
references. Local reusable-workflow jobs can inherit or explicitly map declared
secret aliases.

The compiler records names, not values, in the destination job plan. At
runtime, the job calls `buildkite-agent secret get NAME` and registers the value
with both redactors before use. Missing or denied secrets fail without printing
the secret or Agent error. The job annotation explains how to create or migrate
the secret, check its access policy, or retry a temporarily unavailable secret
service.

These are Buildkite destination-job secrets, not GitHub repository,
environment, event, or fork-scoped secrets. Buildkite Secret access policies
are the authorization boundary. Code in the same job can also call
`buildkite-agent secret get`. Jobs with a [GitHub
environment](#deployment-environments) resolve environment-defined secret names
through the `<ENVIRONMENT>_<NAME>` naming convention; the values remain
ordinary Buildkite secrets.

`GITHUB_TOKEN` stays on its separate workflow-token contract and cannot be
replaced by an ordinary Buildkite secret.

Unsupported secret uses include:

- dynamic, whole-context, filtered, or projected access
- conditions and other compile-time expressions
- remote reusable-workflow secret forwarding
- literals, compound expressions, or references through `needs`, `vars`, `env`,
  `inputs`, or arbitrary `github` properties in explicit mappings

Action metadata cannot add secret authority to a plan. A secret used only by an
optional action input becomes an empty value unless another field requires it.

Jobs with `id-token: write` expose the GitHub Actions `getIDToken()` contract to
host JavaScript actions, including those called by composite actions. The
endpoint mints a Buildkite OIDC token for the requested audience. Cloud identity
providers must trust Buildkite's issuer and claims, not GitHub's.

`id-token: read`, `id-token: none`, and omitted permissions do not expose the
endpoint. Repository tests cover the wire contract; hosted runtime proof remains
pending.

The plugin can apply additional Buildkite OIDC settings to every mint:

```yaml
plugins:
  - github-actions#latest:
      workflow: .github/workflows/deploy.yml
      oidc:
        claims: [organization_id]
        aws-session-tags: [organization_slug, pipeline_id]
        subject-claim: pipeline_id
```

`claims` and `aws-session-tags` accept non-empty lists. `subject-claim` accepts
one non-empty immutable claim name. The Agent API owns the claim vocabulary and
rejects unsupported names when the job mints a token.

Plugin OIDC configuration does not grant `id-token: write`. A job without that
permission receives no endpoint.

The endpoint variables are scoped to each host action lifecycle invocation. Shell steps, Docker container actions, and actions running in job containers do not receive them. Container actions that call `getIDToken()` fail with its missing endpoint variable diagnostic.

### GitHub services

**❌ Unsupported beyond the integrations listed above.** An action's runtime may still require unsupported GitHub services. Buildkite provides no GitHub Packages, Releases, Checks, or deployment service emulation beyond the documented integrations.

## Runtime behavior and limits

### Default environment

The runtime sets `GITHUB_REF`, `GITHUB_REF_NAME`, and `GITHUB_REF_TYPE` from the corresponding [`github` context fields](#expressions-and-contexts). Shell steps and actions receive the same values. Workflow, job, step, action, and `GITHUB_ENV` entries cannot override these process variables.

The runtime sets `GITHUB_WORKFLOW` to the workflow's top-level `name`. If the workflow has no name, it uses the repository-relative workflow path. `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_REF` identifies that top-level workflow as `<owner>/<repo>/<path>@<event-ref>`, and `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SHA` is the event commit. Jobs expanded from local, public, or private reusable workflows retain this caller identity. Workflow and step environment entries cannot override these values.

### Runner tools

Linux tools come from the [selected host environment](#job-configuration).
macOS and Windows agents must provide tools used by shell steps. Runner labels
do not guarantee GitHub image parity. The runtime
sets `RUNNER_OS` and `RUNNER_ARCH` to `Linux`/`X64`, `macOS`/`ARM64`, or `Windows`/`X64`, and
`RUNNER_ENVIRONMENT` to `self-hosted`. Workflow and step environment entries
cannot override these values.

On Linux, `RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE` is job-private unless the backend requests the
hosted tool cache. An explicit `tool_cache: true` selects `/opt/hostedtoolcache`
and requires it to exist; `false` uses the job-private cache without changing
the host's preinstalled tools. Native Namespace targets currently return
`false`. When the field is absent, immutable image targets retain their
existing `/opt/hostedtoolcache` behavior, including local hosted-toolchains
presets and explicitly configured images.

On macOS, the bootstrap creates `/Users/runner/hostedtoolcache`, makes it owned
and writable by the agent user, and selects it as `RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE`. This
requires non-interactive `sudo` and preserves the fixed installation prefix
used by actions such as `ruby/setup-ruby`. Agents must still provide compatible
native dependencies for downloaded tools. macOS container images are unsupported.

On Windows, `RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE` is job-private. Windows container images are unsupported.

### Results, retries, and cancellation

- A runtime-skipped Actions job remains successful in Buildkite, appends `(skipped)` to its job label, and publishes a logical `skipped` result for downstream imported jobs.
- Retry the whole build if a producer result or artifact becomes ambiguous. A deferred matrix step may be retried on its own; retrying its producer job after the matrix expanded requires a new build.
- Cancellation targets the complete process tree. Linux and macOS send `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM` after 7.5 seconds, then `SIGKILL` after another 2.5 seconds. Windows terminates the process tree through a Job Object without a signal grace period.
- Summary, annotation, or skipped-label publication failure produces a warning and does not change a completed job result.

## Validation

Check syntax, static graph construction, and every declared trigger without an event:

```sh
buildkite-gha validate .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

This result is event-independent and does not claim hosted admission.

Apply the same profile as production upload:

```sh
buildkite-gha validate \
  --profile hosted \
  --event-path .buildkite/events/current.json \
  .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

Use `--event` instead of `--event-path` to evaluate the hosted profile with a
generated minimal snapshot. See the [CLI guide](cli.md#validate-a-workflow) for supported
events and representative payloads, including deployment events. Generated
snapshots are compatibility test inputs, not proof of every activity or
equivalents to real payloads. The options are mutually exclusive.

Use `--all-events` to evaluate every declared supported event separately. Its `processing-report/v3` output preserves the event-independent result and each generated event's v2 report. Aggregate admission means every generated snapshot was admitted; it does not cover other payload shapes. A `context-required` result means compilation and hosted-policy checks passed, but generated inputs cannot measure a supported admission path, such as push or pull-request path filters without linked webhook and local diff evidence. It does not claim admission.

The results mean:

- **Compilable**: Syntax, declared triggers, and the static job graph can be translated.
- **Not applicable**: The workflow does not declare the selected event, so upload would skip it without compiling it.
- **Admitted**: Resolved actions and generated plans pass production policy.
- **Context required**: A supported admission path needs evidence that this validation input does not provide.
- **Runtime-proven**: Repository tests or hosted evidence have executed the behavior.

Admission does not execute arbitrary action code. An admitted action may still depend on an unsupported GitHub service.

See the [CLI guide](cli.md) for event snapshots, JSON reports, compilation, and direct upload.
