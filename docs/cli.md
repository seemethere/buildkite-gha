# Use the buildkite-gha CLI

The [GitHub Actions Buildkite plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/github-actions-buildkite-plugin)
is the easiest way to run `buildkite-gha`. Use the CLI directly when you need
to validate a workflow, inspect generated output, or build a custom importer.

| Command | Use it to |
| --- | --- |
| `validate` | Check one workflow and, optionally, production policy. |
| `validate-batch` | Check a large workflow corpus. |
| `compile` | Render pipeline YAML or compiler IR without uploading it. |
| `upload` | Upload workflows from a custom importer. |

`run-job` and the `upload --stage-digest` form are internal commands that
generated steps run. Do not invoke them directly.

## Before you begin

Install `buildkite-gha` with `mise` 2026.5.12 or newer:

```sh
mise use -g --minimum-release-age 0s github:buildkite/buildkite-gha
```

The override avoids mise's default 24-hour release delay. Without it, mise may
select an older release that has no artifact for your platform.

Append `@<version>` to install an exact release. If a custom importer creates
jobs for the other supported platform, it must download and verify that
platform's distribution from the same release.

Jobs with JavaScript actions need `mise`. The runtime checks
`BUILDKITE_GHA_MISE`, then `PATH`, then downloads a verified managed copy.
Shell-only, native-adapter, and Docker-only jobs do not need it.

When a managed cache is configured, the runtime installs Node there rather
than reusing system-wide mise installations. The install directory remains
pinned even when an agent's mise wrapper overrides `MISE_DATA_DIR`.

Managed Node binaries require glibc 2.28 or newer. The Go CLI has no glibc requirement.

## Validate a workflow

Validate syntax, the static graph, and every declared trigger without an event:

```sh
buildkite-gha validate .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

This event-independent check validates syntax, triggers, and the static graph.
It accepts valid push and pull-request path filters because upload can evaluate
them later with linked-webhook data and a verified local Git diff.

It does not:

- resolve actions
- evaluate event payload expressions
- claim that production policy would admit the workflow

Malformed filters, unsupported filter combinations, and unsupported pull
request activity types still fail. See [Names and triggers](compatibility.md#names-and-triggers)
for the exact trigger contract.

Resolve actions and apply production policy:

```sh
buildkite-gha validate \
  --profile hosted \
  --event-path .buildkite/events/current.json \
  .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

For a quick compatibility check, generate a minimal supported event snapshot:

```sh
buildkite-gha validate \
  --profile hosted \
  --event pull_request \
  .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

`--event` supports `push`, `pull_request`, `merge_group`, `release`, `deployment`, `deployment_status`, `create`, `delete`, `label`, `fork`, `public`, `gollum`, `page_build`, `watch`, `milestone`, `branch_protection_rule`, `discussion`, `discussion_comment`, `issues`,
`issue_comment`, `pull_request_review`, `pull_request_review_comment`,
`workflow_dispatch`, and `schedule`. It requires
`--profile hosted` and cannot be combined with `--event-path`.

The generated snapshot contains an example repository and the minimum event
fields. It is useful for a quick check, but it is not a real payload. The
release snapshot represents one stable, non-prerelease `published` event. The
issues snapshot represents `opened`, review represents `submitted`, and both
comment events represent `created`. Deployment snapshots use the `staging` branch
and `preview` environment; deployment status represents `success`. Use
`--event-path` when exact refs, activity, repository identity, or payload fields
matter.

Use `--all-events` with `--profile hosted` to evaluate each declared supported
event with its own generated snapshot:

```sh
buildkite-gha validate \
  --profile hosted \
  --all-events \
  .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

`--all-events` cannot be combined with `--event` or `--event-path`. It does not
evaluate `workflow_call` as a standalone event.

Each generated event is checked separately. The result does not cover every
possible real payload. `context-required` means the available checks passed,
but admission needs evidence the generated snapshot cannot provide. Push and
pull-request path filters, for example, need linked-webhook data and a verified
local Git diff.

Reuse downloaded immutable action source across profile validation runs:

```sh
mkdir -p .buildkite-gha-action-cache
buildkite-gha validate \
  --profile hosted \
  --all-events \
  --action-cache-dir .buildkite-gha-action-cache \
  .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

`--action-cache-dir` is available only with `--profile hosted`. It stores
verified action source by immutable commit, separately from the ref-resolution
cache that avoids repeated GitHub API requests.

Mutable ref resolutions are cached for one hour under
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/buildkite-gha/action-ref-resolutions/v1`, or the platform's
user cache directory. Concurrent importers can share this cache, so a moved
tag or branch may use its previous commit for up to one hour. Uploads with
`private-reusable-workflows` enabled skip this cache for called repositories
and resolve their refs once per operation. Do not share either writable cache
between untrusted jobs.

On ephemeral Linux agents, mount a persistent directory writable only by trusted
importers and set `XDG_CACHE_HOME` for the importer command. Keep its host path
outside writable mounts available to imported jobs. For example, with
that directory mounted at `/cache/importer`:

```sh
XDG_CACHE_HOME="${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-/cache/importer}" \
  buildkite-gha upload --event-path event.json .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

This preserves an explicit cache override and lets later invocations reuse
fresh ref resolutions. Persisting only `--action-cache-dir` does not preserve
the ref-resolution cache. Full commit SHA references need no resolution request.

For a large workflow corpus, reuse one validator process and action resolver:

```sh
buildkite-gha validate-batch \
  --manifest workflows.jsonl \
  --output-dir reports \
  --corpus-id zenodo:20340547 \
  --action-cache-dir .buildkite-gha-action-cache \
  --action-cache-max-bytes 21474836480 \
  --action-resolution-snapshot .buildkite-gha-action-resolutions
```

Each JSON Lines manifest record requires `id`, `repository`, `path`, `hash`, and
`source`. Batch validation:

- applies the hosted profile to every declared supported event
- writes one `processing-report/v3` JSON file per workflow
- uses one worker per CPU unless `--jobs` overrides it
- publishes each report atomically
- resumes reports only when the corpus, record, workflow dependencies,
  validator executable, and action-resolution generation still match

Records with unresolved local dependencies are processed again.

`--action-cache-max-bytes` requires `--action-cache-dir`. When the cache exceeds
the limit, validation evicts the least recently used immutable action trees.
Concurrent validators lock active entries. Maintenance removes abandoned
partial entries but leaves active ones alone. The public corpus script defaults
to 20 GiB.

The required `--action-resolution-snapshot` pins each mutable
`owner/repository@ref` to the first commit it resolves. Reusing the same
generation keeps those refs stable across validator versions. Exact commit
references bypass the snapshot.

The snapshot records definitively missing public refs. It does not record
network, cancellation, TLS, rate-limit, or server failures; those are retried.
Rate-limited requests follow the [action resolver's retry deadline](compatibility.md#action-sources-and-runtimes).
Use `--refresh-action-resolution-snapshot` to start a new generation. The public
corpus script then removes old report sets for that corpus record.

The snapshot pins action revisions only. It does not make the whole corpus run
reproducible.

For authenticated GitHub API resolution, keep the token in an environment variable and name that variable without exposing its value:

```sh
GITHUB_TOKEN="$(your-secure-token-command)" \
  buildkite-gha validate-batch \
  --manifest workflows.jsonl \
  --output-dir reports \
  --corpus-id example \
  --action-resolution-snapshot .buildkite-gha-action-resolutions \
  --github-token-env GITHUB_TOKEN
```

The token authenticates GitHub API metadata requests only. It is not written to
arguments, logs, reports, snapshots, or action caches. Validation does not run
action subprocesses, and it still verifies that every action repository is
public.

Inspect the aggregate result and each event outcome:

```sh
buildkite-gha validate \
  --profile hosted \
  --all-events \
  --format json \
  .github/workflows/ci.yml |
  jq '{result, events: [.evaluations[] | {event, result: .report.result}]}'
```

Inspect diagnostics with their generated event names:

```sh
buildkite-gha validate \
  --profile hosted \
  --all-events \
  --format json \
  .github/workflows/ci.yml |
  jq -r '(.validation.diagnostics[] | "validation: \(.code): \(.message)"),
    (.evaluations[] | .event as $event | .report.diagnostics[] | "\($event): \(.code): \(.message)")'
```

The deprecated `hosted-tokenless` profile name remains an alias for `hosted`.
Hosted validation uses the same runner preset as production upload.

Use `--format json` for a `buildkite-gha/processing-report/v2` report.
`--all-events` emits v3, containing the event-independent report and one v2
report per generated event.

The top-level result is:

- `admitted` only when every event is admitted
- `context-required` when generated input cannot measure an otherwise supported
  path, unless another finding takes precedence

Reports cover every stage from parsing through pipeline generation. If an
earlier stage blocks a later one, the later stage is `not-evaluated`, not
`failed`.

Warnings and errors become job-scoped Buildkite annotations. A failure that
aborts `validate`, `compile`, or upload attaches to the current job. Generated
failure steps attach their own diagnostics. Their logs identify the root
workflow and each diagnostic's source location, job, matrix instance, action,
and step when available. Failure logs use bold red errors, amber warnings,
and cyan workflow/source context, with blank lines between diagnostics.
Importer logs and generated failure logs share annotations' human-readable
explanations, source excerpts, and diagnostic details. Internal diagnostic codes
remain in structured reports and telemetry rather than these logs. Warning-only
importer output uses an amber `Workflow diagnostics` heading. Untrusted terminal
control characters are removed without changing the underlying report data.
If the CLI cannot publish an annotation, it warns without changing the command
result.

For fetched public and private reusable workflows, source locations in
annotations link to the resolved commit and line in the source repository,
including nested local calls inside that repository. The link opens only for
viewers with GitHub access to that repository. Generated failure logs make the
source path and coordinates an OSC 8 terminal hyperlink to the same URL, without
a separate URL line. Terminals without hyperlink support display the label.
If the source could not be fetched, the CLI keeps the location without guessing
a revision.

Local workflow links use the event's commit only when its file in the checkout's
Git object database matches the bytes parsed. This includes local reusable
workflows and early syntax errors. Logs and annotations display local source
paths relative to the checkout when possible. They keep
the location without a link for edited inputs, unavailable revisions, files
outside the checkout, or files larger than the 1 MiB verification limit. Changes
on disk after parsing do not change which source revision the diagnostic links to.

Annotations and generated failure logs include a real configuration excerpt
where safe: literal action/workflow references in `uses`, standard Ubuntu,
Windows, or macOS `runs-on` labels, and built-in step `shell` names. Excerpts
retain the parsed line numbers, mark the offending line with `>`, and underline
the reference, runner label, or shell with `^`.
Standalone trigger filter keys, such as `branches:` and `types:`, also appear
with an underline. Filter values and inline filter declarations are omitted.
Rejected filters, invalid filter patterns, and unsupported activity types link
to their filter key. Errors without a corresponding field retain the event
declaration location.
Only eligible adjacent lines are included. Scripts, `env`, `with`, comments,
expressions, aliases, malformed YAML, and other unclassified content are omitted.
Capture is limited to 240 bytes per line and 16 KiB per workflow; excerpts are
excluded from JSON reports and telemetry. At annotation size limits, the excerpt
is dropped before shortening the explanation.

Profile validation applies upload's trigger policy before compilation.
`not-applicable` means the workflow does not declare the selected event and
would become a skipped top-level step. Malformed event data is incompatible. An
unsupported trigger beside a supported one produces a warning.

Validation may use the public network to resolve actions. It does not install
Node or execute workflow code. It calls Buildkite only to publish annotations
when it runs inside a Buildkite job.

## Provide an event snapshot

`compile` and profile validation with `--event-path` need a bounded event snapshot:

```json
{
  "provider": "github",
  "event": "push",
  "repository": {
    "owner": "acme",
    "name": "widgets",
    "clone_url": "https://github.com/acme/widgets.git",
    "default_branch": "main"
  },
  "ref": "refs/heads/main",
  "sha": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567",
  "actor": "octocat",
  "payload": {
    "ref": "refs/heads/main"
  }
}
```

The snapshot supplies compile-time context. Plans retain the event name,
repository, refs, SHA, actor, and a payload digest. Upload stores the snapshot's
payload once as a content-addressed artifact and marks each job to load it for
[`GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`](compatibility.md#event-file), even without event expressions.

The snapshot is compatibility data, not authorization.

## Compile a pipeline

Render Buildkite pipeline YAML:

```sh
buildkite-gha compile \
  --event-path .buildkite/events/current.json \
  .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

Inspect compiler IR:

```sh
buildkite-gha compile \
  --event-path .buildkite/events/current.json \
  --format ir-json \
  .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

Inside a Buildkite job, the IR includes the resolved
[repository and organization variables](compatibility.md#repository-and-organization-variables)
when the workflow references `vars`.

Workflows whose jobs declare a GitHub
[`environment`](compatibility.md#deployment-environments) need GitHub
environment access at compile time. Inside a Buildkite job, `upload` and
`compile` resolve environments automatically through the job-scoped Agent API;
no GitHub token reaches the importer. Outside a job, `compile` fails for such
workflows with an error naming the job and its environment; there is no token
option.

`compile` does not upload the executable, plans, or pipeline, so piping its YAML directly to `buildkite-agent pipeline upload` is incomplete.

A workflow with a
[matrix](compatibility.md#matrices-from-job-outputs) or
[runner selection](compatibility.md#runners-from-job-outputs) from a job output has jobs
that only exist after a deferred step runs inside the build, so `compile`
renders its IR but not its pipeline YAML:

```
buildkite-gha: compile: job "build" takes its matrix from a job output, so upload expands it with a deferred step inside the build; the pipeline format cannot render it. Use --format ir-json to inspect the compiled graph.
```

The IR lists the deferred step and its jobs under `continuations`.

## Upload from a custom importer

`upload` is the public in-build command for custom importers:

```sh
buildkite-gha upload .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

The importer must run on Linux/amd64 or Darwin/arm64 with Buildkite agent v3.129 or newer, `BUILDKITE=true`, and `BUILDKITE_STEP_KEY`.

The hidden, zero-argument `buildkite-gha plugin` entry point reads plugin
configuration from `BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_CONFIGURATION`. It accepts:

- either one `workflow` path or a non-empty `workflows` array
- `runners` and `oidc`
- plugin-owned `version`, `source-ref`, and `minimum-release-age` fields
- the Boolean `experimental-runner-user` and `private-reusable-workflows` fields

### Private-preview Pipeline Trigger selection

Server-selected workflow imports are available only in private-preview GitHub
Actions Pipeline Trigger builds. Most users should configure an explicit
`workflow` or `workflows` selector.

Without an explicit selector, `BUILDKITE_GITHUB_WORKFLOW_PATH` marks a GitHub
Actions Pipeline Trigger selection. The server also supplies:

- `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME`: `push`, `pull_request`, `issues`, `issue_comment`,
  `pull_request_review`, `pull_request_review_comment`, `release`, `merge_group`,
  `deployment`, `deployment_status`, `create`, `delete`, `label`, `fork`, `public`, `gollum`, `page_build`, `watch`, `milestone`, `branch_protection_rule`, `discussion`, or `discussion_comment`
- `GITHUB_WORKFLOW`: the workflow `name`, or its repository-relative path when
  `name` is absent
- `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_REF`:
  `<owner>/<repo>/<repository-relative-path>@<event-ref>`
- `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SHA`: the full commit used to match the workflow
- `BUILDKITE_GITHUB_EVENT`: a compatibility duplicate of `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME`
- `BUILDKITE_GITHUB_ACTION`: the event activity, including `checks_requested` for merge groups; push
  and deployment events, plus `create`, `delete`, `fork`, `public`, `gollum`, and `page_build`, omit it

The `GITHUB_*` values take precedence when present. The plugin derives the
selected path from `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_REF`, checks `GITHUB_WORKFLOW` against the
checked-out file, and requires `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SHA` to match the checkout
commit. A malformed preferred value fails instead of falling back.
For pull requests, `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_REF` and imported jobs' `GITHUB_REF` retain
`refs/pull/<number>/merge`, while `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SHA`, `GITHUB_SHA`, and the
Buildkite checkout use the pull request head commit.
Review and inline review-comment events use the same PR-head contract. They
require both workflow identity fields and the original `buildkite:webhook`
payload. The PR number, head SHA, head/base branches, activity, and all three
repository identities must agree with the build. Missing payloads (including
rebuilds without retained webhook data) fail closed, not as synthetic PR events.
For `issues` and `issue_comment`, the ref is the current repository default
branch and the SHA is its server-verified tip. Both identity fields are
required. The linked payload action and repository must match the Buildkite
environment, and `issue_comment` accepts both issue and pull request
conversation comments.
For `release`, both workflow identity fields and the original linked payload
are required. The ref identifies the release tag; the SHA identifies its
server-resolved peeled commit. Repository, tag, branch, and activity must agree.
Draft releases reject `created`, `edited`, `deleted`, and `unpublished`. See
[release compatibility](compatibility.md#names-and-triggers).
Deployment events require both workflow identity fields and the original linked
payload. Workflows use the deployment commit and branch/tag ref, or an empty
Actions ref for SHA-only deployments. SHA-only workflow identity uses `@<sha>`.
See [deployment compatibility](compatibility.md#names-and-triggers) for provenance
checks and inactive-status suppression.
For `merge_group`, both workflow identity fields and the original linked payload
are required. The selected ref/SHA identifies the speculative head; the distinct
base branch/SHA must match Buildkite's merge-queue metadata. Only tokenless
workflows are supported. See [merge-group compatibility](compatibility.md#names-and-triggers).
`BUILDKITE_GITHUB_WORKFLOW_PATH` remains the path fallback because GitHub has no
`GITHUB_WORKFLOW_PATH`. `BUILDKITE_GITHUB_ACTION` remains the action source
because GitHub's `GITHUB_ACTION` has a different meaning. An explicit
`workflow` or `workflows` value takes precedence over server workflow selection.

Use the plugin shorthand to request server selection:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ":github:"
    plugin: github-actions
```

This server-selected form does not require the importer step to have a `key`.
The plugin uploads the event, runtime, and plan artifacts before uploading the
dynamic pipeline, and scopes artifact reads to the importer job. It does not use
the job ID as a dependency key. Explicit-selector importers still require a
step `key` and generated workflow groups depend on it.

Missing or untracked explicitly configured workflow paths warn and are skipped.
If every configured path is missing or untracked, the plugin succeeds without
uploading a pipeline. A missing or untracked server-selected path fails. Every
present path must be a regular, tracked `.yml` or `.yaml` file inside the
repository. Directories, tracked files missing from the checkout, symlinks, and
globs are rejected. The optional `oidc` object accepts non-empty `claims`,
`aws-session-tags`, and `subject-claim` values. Unknown fields and invalid values
fail before upload.

The plugin resolves relative workflow paths from `BUILDKITE_BUILD_CHECKOUT_PATH`,
not the command hook's working directory.

The importer reuses its verified executable for jobs on the same platform. It
downloads the other platform's distribution from the same release only when a
workflow needs it. Runner mappings apply to generated jobs, not the importer.

### Configure generated-job cache volumes

An explicit runner mapping can attach one Buildkite Hosted cache volume to each
generated job using that mapping:

```yaml
plugins:
  - github-actions#latest:
      workflow: .github/workflows/ci.yml
      runners:
        - runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          queue: hosted
          cache:
            paths:
              - /home/runner/.gradle/caches
              - /home/runner/.gradle/wrapper
            name: gradle-dependencies
            size: 40g
```

`cache.paths` is a required, non-empty list of unique absolute paths. `name`
and `size` are optional. Names follow Buildkite's 100-character
letters-numbers-hyphens format and may contain `${BUILDKITE_*}` variables.
Sizes use `Ng` and must be at least `20g`. Without a name or size, Buildkite
uses its pipeline-scoped name and 20 GB defaults.

Each Buildkite step supports one cache volume. When a job also needs the
internally managed mise cache, `buildkite-gha` adds the mise path to the same
volume. A configured name and size apply to that combined volume; otherwise,
the managed mise name and Buildkite's default size remain unchanged. Jobs with
neither configuration emit no `cache` attribute.

Runner cache volumes are not supported for workflow jobs that set `container`.

Generated Linux jobs run as `runner`. Configured cache paths are made writable
by that user after the bootstrap verifies that they target the Buildkite cache
volume. Prefer narrowly scoped paths.
For example, caching an entire Gradle User Home also persists `init.d` scripts
and other executable configuration, increasing the impact of cache poisoning.
Caching only `caches` and `wrapper` reduces that exposure, but a cache-volume
miss does not provide setup-gradle's archive-cache fallback once the mounted
`caches` directory exists.

Cache volumes are best-effort accelerators, scoped to the Buildkite pipeline
and cluster. They commit after successful jobs and are abandoned after failed
jobs. Do not use them as durable or trusted storage. See [Buildkite cache
volumes](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/buildkite-hosted/cache-volumes).

### Select workflows

Pass every workflow path explicitly:

```sh
buildkite-gha upload -- \
  .github/workflows/ci.yml \
  .github/workflows/release.yml
```

Every operand must name one regular `.yml` or `.yaml` file. For multiple
workflows, every path must be tracked inside the repository. Upload
canonicalizes, deduplicates, and sorts aliases, so argument order does not
change the pipeline.

Directories, globs, missing files, other extensions, and symlinks fail before
parsing or Buildkite commands run. Multiple-workflow uploads also reject
untracked and outside paths.

`--` ends option parsing. Use it before any externally supplied paths, and
always when a path begins with `-`. Pass each path as its own argument; the CLI
does not split one shell string or decode a JSON or YAML list.

Upload is atomic. Skipped workflows become top-level skipped steps.
Reusable-only files remain available to local callers but do not create groups.
Selecting only reusable workflows is an error.

An explicit non-empty workflow `run-name` appends ` — <run-name>` to its group
label after resolving supported `github` and `inputs` expressions. Workflow
names, provider-check names, and the Buildkite build message remain unchanged.

See [Aggregate workflow upload](compatibility.md#aggregate-workflow-upload) for
workflow grouping, labels, provider checks, and failure behavior.

Private reusable workflows are off by default. Set the plugin's
`private-reusable-workflows: true` field, or pass
`upload --private-reusable-workflows` from a custom importer. See
[Reusable workflows](compatibility.md#reusable-workflows) for the access
boundary and [Security](security.md#repository-data-does-not-grant-authority)
for the credential boundary.

A safe compilation or trigger-translation error replaces only that workflow
with a failing top-level step. Compilation continues for later workflows.
Parse, event-input, admission, artifact, and upload failures abort the complete
transaction; no partial pipeline is uploaded.

### Select the effective event

Event source precedence is:

1. `--event-path`
1. `buildkite:webhook` metadata reserved by Buildkite
1. A reduced snapshot derived from `BUILDKITE_*` variables when no linked webhook is available

An explicit path never reads Buildkite metadata. Webhook metadata must be one
valid JSON object no larger than 25 MiB. Malformed, unreadable, or oversized
data stops upload instead of falling back. Buildkite's repository mapping,
commit, and ref remain authoritative.

Raw webhook data is not embedded in generated plans or pipeline YAML. Upload
retains one content-addressed event artifact for linked webhooks and explicit
snapshots, so every job and its retries can read the [event file](compatibility.md#event-file).
For reduced fallback snapshots, it retains the artifact only when runtime event
expressions require it. Event data cannot grant queues, secrets, or tokens.

The selected snapshot establishes one event for applicability, compilation,
workflow conditions, provider-check names, and explicit run-name evaluation. An
explicit event is never replaced with live Buildkite fields.

Linked webhook data can provide native `merge_group`, `release`, and `issues`
events. GitHub Actions Pipeline Trigger identity additionally supports `merge_group`, `release`,
`deployment`, `deployment_status`, `create`, `delete`, `label`, `fork`, `public`, `gollum`, `page_build`, `watch`, `milestone`, `branch_protection_rule`, `discussion`, `discussion_comment`, `issues`, `issue_comment`, and PR review events without native event settings. Merge
groups and releases need matching Buildkite refs, commits, and
activity. Release also needs a valid payload and a tag matching `BUILDKITE_TAG`
and `BUILDKITE_BRANCH`. Issue and comment payloads need a valid action, object
identity, and repository matching the Buildkite checkout. The GitHub Code
Access App provides immutable server provenance and is required for hosted
release `GITHUB_TOKEN` issuance.

See [Names and triggers](compatibility.md#names-and-triggers) for exact matching
rules and the environment fallback.

A top-level workflow that does not declare the event becomes a skipped step with
no plan artifacts. If none apply, upload succeeds with a skipped-only pipeline.

For an applicable workflow, only the selected event contributes a workflow
condition. Supported branch, tag, base-branch, and activity filters add their
constraints. A verified path-filter nonmatch becomes a skipped step without
workflow jobs or plan artifacts. Conditions from different events are never combined.

Unsupported or uncertain filters replace only the affected workflow with a
failing step. Push and pull-request path filters need a linked webhook and a
matching local checkout. Generated or explicit snapshots can report that need,
but cannot grant admission. Malformed event data stops the import.

Buildkite owns schedule identity, so every `on.schedule` workflow is eligible
for every Buildkite scheduled build.

After all applicable workflows have been attempted, the command uploads the exact executable, content-addressed plans, and synthetic failure steps in one artifact batch with a concurrency limit of 8. It then runs one:

```sh
buildkite-agent pipeline upload --no-interpolation
```

Buildkite Agent v4 rejects pipeline uploads containing secrets by default.

### Choose runners and runtimes

Use repeatable mappings before the workflow path:

```sh
buildkite-gha upload \
  --runner-queue ubuntu-latest=hosted \
  --runner-queue macos-14=macos-sonoma-arm64 \
  --runtime-distribution darwin/arm64=/opt/buildkite-gha-darwin \
  .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

The hosted preset accepts runner labels case-insensitively, so aliases such as
`macOS-latest` and `Ubuntu-Latest` are equivalent to their lowercase forms.
Local presets use Noble for `ubuntu-latest` and `ubuntu-24.04`, and Jammy for
`ubuntu-22.04`. Backend resolution can instead select a native Linux environment
through agent tags. Use `--runner-image` with an immutable digest
to override the preset for a configured profile; backend tags never replace
that explicit image. An explicit mapping declares
that its selector runs on Linux x86-64, except for the known macOS and Windows labels, and
bypasses Agent API resolution. The Agent API owns compatibility and returns the
complete target for every other selector. The importer publishes returned
warnings as annotations. See [Compatibility](compatibility.md#job-configuration)
for runner behavior. Runtime distribution paths must be absolute executables.
The importer's platform defaults to its running executable; other platforms
have no direct-upload default.
`BUILDKITE_GHA_TARGET_QUEUE` and `BUILDKITE_GHA_RUNTIME_IMAGE` are no longer
supported.

For [experimental Windows jobs](compatibility.md#experimental-windows-jobs),
explicitly map `windows-latest` or `windows-2022` and supply the matching
Windows x86-64 runtime from the same release:

```sh
buildkite-gha upload \
  --event-path event.json \
  --runner-queue windows-2022=my-windows-queue \
  --runtime-distribution windows/amd64=/opt/buildkite-gha.exe \
  .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

The plugin acquires the Windows runtime from the same release only when a
selected workflow requires it. Development plugin runs use
`BUILDKITE_GHA_PLUGIN_DEV_WINDOWS_RUNTIME` as an absolute path to a locally
built Windows executable. Windows targets reject `--runner-image` and cache
volumes. These mappings do not create queues or grant hosted Windows access.

The deprecated `--runtime-queue hosted` argument is accepted as a no-op for compatibility with plugin releases that pass it. Other values are rejected.

### Expand a matrix inside the build

When a workflow takes matrices or runner selections from job outputs, `upload` creates one deferred
step per group of overlapping downstream jobs, in addition to the static jobs
(see [Matrices from job outputs](compatibility.md#matrices-from-job-outputs) and
[Runners from job outputs](compatibility.md#runners-from-job-outputs)).
The importer needs `BUILDKITE_JOB_ID` for this. Every runtime platform the
expanded jobs may need must already be configured with `--runtime-distribution`;
a row that selects an unconfigured platform fails the deferred step. The importer
resolves repository and organization variables when any job of the workflow,
deferred or not, reads `vars` in the workflow or in an action it uses, and
records the scopes for the deferred steps. Such a workflow is never uploaded
job by job: when any of its jobs fails compilation, the whole workflow is
replaced with one failing step, because a partial upload would drop the
deferred steps.

The importer and every deferred step are stages of one compilation. Each
stage compiles the whole workflow through the same compile path, uploads the
jobs whose scheduling values it knows, and writes a stage record for each boundary the
compiler still defers. The deferred step downloads the importer's executable,
then runs the internal form of the same command:

```sh
buildkite-gha upload \
  --stage-digest sha256:<digest> \
  --stage-producer <job-id>
```

This form accepts no other options or operands. `--stage-producer` is the job
whose artifacts hold the stage record: the importer for the first deferred
step of a component, or the earlier deferred step when a matrix chains from a
job that step compiled (see
[Matrices from job outputs](compatibility.md#matrices-from-job-outputs)). The
event source and the runtimes always come from the importer the record names.
Releases before this form emitted a separate `continue` command; a deferred
step always runs the executable digest its own importer uploaded, so the two
never mix inside one build.

A stage step runs inside a Buildkite job with `BUILDKITE=true`,
`BUILDKITE_BUILD_ID`, `BUILDKITE_JOB_ID`, and the default checkout. It:

1. downloads the stage record, verifies its digest and compiler version, and
   checks that the workflow in the checkout is byte-for-byte the one the
   importer compiled; the record also holds the action revisions and the
   variable scopes the importer resolved for the deferred jobs, so a stage
   never requests variables itself, and the rows every earlier stage of a
   chained component resolved
2. reads each producer's verified result through the same manifest path
   that `needs` outputs use, bound to its exact instance key and plan digest;
   a verified non-success result skips that root's downstream jobs, while a
   missing or invalid manifest fails the step before any upload; earlier
   producers must still match their recorded results (see
   [matrix retries](compatibility.md#matrices-from-job-outputs))
3. expands successful outputs with the static-matrix rules and limits, or
   evaluates the runner selection using an output of at most 1 KiB; checks
   that the rows and dependents fit the share of the 1,024-job limit the record
   holds for this step (see
   [Matrices from job outputs](compatibility.md#matrices-from-job-outputs)),
   recompiles the
   workflow with the recorded event, variables, runner mappings, OIDC, and
   `private-reusable-workflows` settings and the recorded rows of earlier
   stages, reads remote reusable workflows and
   actions through the same repository source as `upload`, resolves runners
   through the Agent API as `upload` does,
   requires the jobs the earlier uploads created to compile identically,
   requires each deferred job to come from the workflow source the importer
   recorded, including the commit of a reusable workflow from another
   repository, and pins each deferred job's actions to the recorded revisions
4. uploads the plans and a pipeline holding only the deferred jobs whose scheduling values
   exist, including skipped placeholders where needed; joins appear once, and
   outside prerequisites remain references to steps already in the build.
   When some deferred jobs read their matrix from a job this upload compiled,
   the pipeline also holds the next stage's deferred step, and the upload
   writes that step's stage record with the rows accepted so far and the
   unused part of this step's job share

Buildkite rejects an upload whose step keys already exist. When that happens,
the stage confirms through `buildkite-agent step get` that each expected step
carries the plan it just compiled and exits 0, so retrying the deferred step
never duplicates jobs. For skipped jobs in a merged component, it also verifies
the command marker bound to the stage record digest. A missing step
or a different binding fails the replay. For
[output-derived scheduling](compatibility.md#scheduling-from-matrix-producer-outputs),
it also compares the concurrency group and limit. Any other failure exits 1 with:

```
Retry the whole build to expand this matrix again. If the matrix producer job was retried, only a new build can expand it.
```

Runner selection failures instead say:

```
Retry the whole build to select this runner again. If the producer job was retried, only a new build can select it.
```

### Run Linux jobs as a non-root user

Generated Linux jobs use a dedicated `runner` user by default. This behavior
requires buildkite-gha v0.13.7 or newer. Jobs can start as root or as an existing
`runner` user with home `/home/runner` and passwordless `sudo`. For a non-root
start, the bootstrap uses `sudo -n` for privileged setup. It creates the
`runner` user when needed, grants passwordless `sudo` and Docker
socket access when the socket exists, prepares the runner home, temp, mise, and
tool-cache paths, then runs `buildkite-gha run-job` as `runner`. The verified
executable and compiled plan remain root-owned and read-only to `runner`.
Generated jobs skip the Buildkite checkout. When a workflow uses
`actions/checkout`, the native adapter clones as `runner`, so the runtime does
not recursively change workspace ownership. This behavior does not depend on a
queue name and does not affect macOS jobs.

During the transition, set the plugin field to `false` to run as the agent's
original user without this bootstrap:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ":github: CI"
    plugins:
      - github-actions#latest:
          workflow: .github/workflows/ci.yml
          experimental-runner-user: false
```

For a custom importer, pass `upload --experimental-runner-user=false`. The bare
`--experimental-runner-user` form and a plugin value of `true` remain accepted.
The plugin value must be a YAML boolean, not a quoted string.

## Disable telemetry

In Buildkite jobs, the importer and runtime send best-effort completion
telemetry through the job-authenticated Agent API. Events contain the command,
outcome, client version, duration, and bounded diagnostics. Diagnostics can
identify a rejected feature with a `blocker` slug and bounded `blocker_detail`,
such as `runner_label` and `windows-latest`. Distinct rejected values remain
separate diagnostics even when they share a diagnostic code.

Workflow diagnostics include their message and detail in `message`, even when
the importer exits zero after uploading failing steps for rejected workflows.
Messages are normalized to one line and retain at most their first 1,024 UTF-8 bytes;
`message_truncated` is true when text was shortened. `workflow_path` identifies
the root workflow being imported, relative to the checkout when possible.
Paths over 1,024 bytes or containing invalid UTF-8 or control characters are
omitted rather than shortened. Deduplication includes the bounded message and
workflow path, subject to the limit of 20 diagnostics per command.

For an unsuccessful command, events also contain a normalized user-visible error
message of at most 1,024 bytes. When a workflow diagnostic attributes the
failure, the message is that diagnostic's text, kept whole so later job output
cannot displace it. Otherwise it is the final bytes of the command's error
output. `error_message_truncated` says whether part of the message was
omitted.

Failed runs also carry a failure phase and a code from a fixed set. The code
separates workflow-authored process exits (`E_STEP_PROCESS_EXIT`) from
unsupported-feature rejections (`E_UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE`) and runtime integrity
failures (`E_RUNTIME_INTEGRITY`), so a failing test suite is not counted as a
compatibility gap. Runtime rejections include the same blocker fields when the
runtime can identify the rejected shell or action reference.
Secret resolution failures use `E_SECRET_UNAVAILABLE`, making secret
availability independently measurable.

Buildkite adds organization, pipeline, build, and job identifiers on the
server. The client does not send workflow or event content, environment
variables, command text, or secrets as separate properties. Blocker details
come from workflow-authored configuration. Event-derived runner labels and
environment expressions are omitted.

Diagnostic messages and error output can include details already printed in
the job log, such as workflow paths, action references, expressions, or invalid
configuration values. Avoid putting secrets in error messages. Disable
telemetry when this diagnostic context must stay inside the job.

Set `BUILDKITE_GHA_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` to disable telemetry. Missing Agent endpoint, job ID, or job token also disables it. Telemetry failures do not change command results.
